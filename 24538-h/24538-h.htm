<div class="italic" lang="fr">
<p>Le Maréchal <span class="smcap">French</span> commandait en Chef l'Armée Britannique au début de
la Guerre.</p>

<p>Comme on le sait, les allemands ont cherché en 1914 à profiter de leur
supériorité numérique et de l'écrasante puissance de leur armement,
pour mettre hors de cause les Armées Alliées d'Occident, par une
man&oelig;uvre enveloppante, aussi rapide que possible.</p>

<p>Après avoir cherché en vain la décision à la <span class="smcap" lang="fr">Marne</span>, puis à l'<span class="smcap">Aisne</span> et
à la <span class="smcap">Somme</span>, ils la poursuivent successivement à <span class="smcap" lang="fr">Arras</span>, sur l'<span class="smcap">Yser</span> et à
<span class="smcap">Ypres</span>.</p>

<p>À mesure que dans cette course à la mer, le terrain disponible se
restreint devant eux, les coups se précipitent et se répètent plus
violents, les réserves s'engagent, de nouveaux Corps d'Armée entrent
en ligne nombreux et intacts. La reddition d'<span class="smcap" lang="fr">Anvers</span> assure d'ailleurs
à l'ennemi d'importantes disponibilités.</p>

<p>Mais déjà l'Armée Belge, appuyée de troupes françaises, arrête les
allemands sur l'<span class="smcap">Yser</span>, de <span class="smcap">Nieuport</span> à <span class="smcap">Dixmude</span>. Après avoir pris part aux
actions de l'<span class="smcap">Aisne</span>, l'Armée Britannique a été transportée dans le
Nord. C'est ainsi qu'elle s'engage <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii" name="pagexii"></a>(p. xii)</span> progressivement de
<span class="smcap" lang="fr">La Bassée</span> à <span class="smcap">Ypres</span>, s'opposant partout à l'invasion.</p>

<p>Bref, les allemands, après avoir vainement développé leurs efforts de
la Mer à la <span class="smcap">Lys</span>, dès le 15 octobre, sont dans l'obligation, à la fin
du mois, de vaincre à <span class="smcap">Ypres</span>, ou bien leur man&oelig;uvre échoue
définitivement, leur offensive expire en Occident et la Coalition
reste debout.</p>

<p>Ainsi sont-ils amenés, sur ce point d'<span class="smcap">Ypres</span>, dans une lutte acharnée,
à concentrer leurs moyens, une forte artillerie lourde largement
approvisionée, renforcée de minenwerfers, de corps d'armée nombreux et
renouvelés.</p>

<p>Quant aux Alliés, ils sont réduits à recevoir le choc avec des
effectifs restreints, des munitions comptées et rares, une faible
artillerie lourde. Toute relève leur est interdite par la pénurie de
troupes, quelle que soit la durée de la bataille. Pour ne citer qu'un
exemple, le premier corps britannique reste engagé du 20 octobre au 15
novembre&mdash;au milieu des plus violentes attaques et malgré de
formidables pertes.</p>

<p>Mais à cette dernière date la bataille était gagnée. Les Alliés
avaient infligé un retentissant échec à l'ennemi: ils avaient sauvé
les communications de la Manche et par là fixé le sort et l'avenir de
la Coalition.</p>

<p>Si l'union étroite du Commandement Allié et la valeur des troupes ont
permis ces glorieux résultats, c'est que le Maréchal <span class="smcap" lang="en">French</span> a déployé
la plus entière <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiii" name="pagexiii"></a>(p. xiii)</span> droiture, la plus complète confiance, la
plus grande énergie: résolu à se faire passer sur le corps plutôt qu'à
reculer.</p>

<p>La Grande-Bretagne avait trouvé en lui un grand soldat. Il avait
maintenu ses troupes à la hauteur de celles de <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>.</p>

<p>Avec l'émotion d'un souvenir profond et toujours vivant, je salue le
vaillant compagnon d'armes des rudes journées et les glorieux drapeaux
Britanniques de la Bataille d'<span class="smcap">Ypres</span>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page001" name="page001"></a>(p. 001)</span></h3>

<h4>PRELIMINARY</h4>

<p>For years past I had regarded a general war in Europe as an eventual
certainty. The experience which I gained during the seven or eight
years spent as a member of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and my
three years tenure of the Office of Chief of the General Staff,
greatly strengthened this conviction.</p>

<p>For reasons which it is unnecessary to enter upon, I resigned my
position as Chief of the Staff in April, 1914, and from that time I
temporarily lost touch with the European situation as it was
officially represented and appreciated.</p>

<p>I remember spending a week in June of that year in Paris, and when
passing through Dover on my return, my old friend, Jimmie Watson
(Colonel Watson, late of the 60th Rifles, <abbr title="Aide de camp">A.D.C.</abbr> to the Khedive of
Egypt), looked into my carriage window and told me of the murder of
the Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his Consort. I cannot say that I
actually regarded this tragedy as being the prelude which should lead
ultimately to a great European convulsion, but in my own mind, and in
view of my past experience, it created a feeling of unrest within me
and an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span> instinctive foreboding of evil. Then came a few weeks
of the calm which heralded the storm&mdash;a calm under cover of which
Germany was vigorously preparing for "the day."</p>

<p>One afternoon, late in July, I was the guest at lunch of the German
Ambassador, Prince Lichnowski. It was a small party, comprising, to
the best of my recollection, only Princess Henry of Pless, Lady
Cunard, Lord Kitchener, His Excellency and myself. The first idea I
got of the storm which was brewing came from a short conversation
which I had with the Ambassador in a corner of the room after lunch.
He was very unhappy and perturbed, and he plainly told me that he
feared all Europe would be in a blaze before we were a fortnight
older. His feeling was prophetic. His surprising candour foreshadowed
the moral courage with which Prince Lichnowski subsequently issued his
famous apologia.</p>

<p>On July 28th Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. The military
preparations of the Dual Monarchy inevitably led to a partial
mobilisation by Russia against Austria, whereupon the German Emperor
proclaimed the "Kriegsgefahrszustand" on July 31st, following this up
by declaring war against Russia on August 1st. On August 2nd German
troops entered Luxemburg and, without declaration of war, violated
French territory. Great Britain declared war against Germany on August
4th and against Austria on August 12th, France having broken off
relations with Austria two days earlier.</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 30th, I was sent for by the Chief of the Imperial
General Staff, and was given private intimation that, if an
expeditionary force were sent to France, I was to command it. On
leaving the room I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span> found some well-known newspaper
correspondents in the passage. I talked a little with them and found
that great doubt existed in their minds as to whether this country
would support France by force of arms. This doubt was certainly shared
by many.</p>

<p>I remember well that on the morning of Saturday, August 1st, the day
upon which Germany declared war on Russia, and it was known that the
breaking out of hostilities between Germany and France was only a
question of hours, I received a visit from the <span lang="fr">Vicomte de la Panouse</span>,
the French Military <span lang="fr">Attaché</span> in London. He told me that the Ambassador
was much disheartened in mind by these doubts and fears. We talked
matters over, and he came to dinner with me that night. Personally, I
felt perfectly sure that so long as Mr. Asquith remained Prime
Minister, and Lord Haldane, Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Winston Churchill
continued to be members of the Cabinet, their voices would guide the
destinies of the British Empire, and that we should remain true to our
friendly understanding with the <span class="italic">Entente</span> Powers. As the result of the
long conversation I had with the <span lang="fr">Vicomte de la Panouse</span>, I think I was
successful in causing this conviction to prevail at the French
Embassy.</p>

<p>England declared war on Germany on Tuesday, August 4th, and on the 5th
the mobilisation of Regulars, Special Reserve and Territorials was
ordered. On Wednesday, August 5th, a Council of War was held at 10,
Downing Street, under the Presidency of the Prime Minister. Nearly all
the members of the Cabinet were present, whilst Lord Roberts, Lord
Kitchener, Sir Charles Douglas, Sir Douglas Haig, the late Sir James
Grierson, General (now Sir Henry) Wilson and myself were directed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> attend. To the best of my recollection the two main subjects
discussed were:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="decimal">
<li>The composition of the Expeditionary Force.</li>
<li>The point of concentration for the British Forces on
  their arrival in France.</li>
</ul>

<p>As regards 1.</p>

<p>It was generally felt that we were under some obligation to France to
send as strong an army as we could, and there was an idea that one
Cavalry Division and six Divisions of all arms had been promised. As
to the exact number, it did not appear that we were under any definite
obligation, but it was unanimously agreed that we should do all we
could. The question to be decided was how many troops it was necessary
to keep in this country adequately to guard our shores against
attempted invasion and, if need be, to maintain internal order.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill briefly described the actual situation of the Navy. He
pointed out that the threat of war had come upon us at a most
opportune moment as regards his own Department, because, only two or
three weeks before, the Fleet had been partially mobilised, and large
reserves called up for the great Naval Review by His Majesty at
Spithead and the extensive naval man&oelig;uvres which followed it. So
far as the Navy was concerned, he considered Home Defence reasonably
secure; but this consideration did not suffice to absolve us from the
necessity of keeping a certain number of troops at home. After this
discussion it was decided that two Divisions must for the moment
remain behind, and that one Cavalry Division and four Divisions of all
arms should be sent out as speedily as possible. This meant a force of
approximately 100,000 men.</p>

<p>As <span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> regards 2.</p>

<p>The British and French General Staffs had for some years been in close
secret consultation with one another on this subject. The German
menace necessitated some preliminary understanding in the event of a
sudden attack. The area of concentration for the British Forces had
been fixed on the left flank of the French, and the actual detraining
stations of the various units were all laid down in terrain lying
between <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> and <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>. The Headquarters of the Army were
fixed at the latter place.</p>

<p>This understanding being purely provisional and conditional upon an
unprovoked attack by Germany, the discussion then took the turn of
overhauling and reviewing these decisions, and of making arrangements
in view of the actual conditions under which war had broken out. Many
and various opinions were expressed; but on this day no final
decisions were arrived at. It was thought absolutely necessary to ask
the French authorities to send over a superior officer who should be
in full possession of the views and intentions of the French General
Staff. It was agreed that no satisfactory decision could be arrived at
until after full discussion with a duly accredited French Officer. I
think this is the gist of the really important points dealt with at
the Council.</p>

<p>During the week the Headquarters of the Expeditionary Force were
established in London at the Hotel Metropole, and the Staff was
constituted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Chief of Staff
<span class="col55"><abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Sir Archibald Murray.</span></li>
<li>Sub-Chief
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</abbr> H. H. Wilson.</span></li>
<li>Adjutant-General
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Major-General">Major-Gen.</abbr> Neville Macready.</span></li>
<li>Quartermaster-General
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Major-General">Major-Gen.</abbr> Sir William Robertson.</span></li>
<li>Director of Intelligence
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</abbr> Macdonogh.</span></li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> <abbr title="Commander Royal Artillery">C.R.A.</abbr>
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Major-General">Major-Gen.</abbr> Lindsay.</span></li>
<li><abbr title="Commander Royal Engineers">C.R.E.</abbr>
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</abbr> Fowke.</span></li>
<li>Military Secretary
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> W. Lambton.</span></li>
<li>Principal Medical Officer
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Surgeon-General">Surg.-Gen.</abbr> T. P. Woodhouse.</span></li>
<li>Principal Veterinary Officer
<span class="col55"><abbr title="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</abbr> J. Moore.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>It was about Thursday the 7th, or Friday the 8th, August, that Lord
Kitchener was appointed Secretary of State for War, and on Monday, the
10th, the Mission sent by the French Government arrived. It was headed
by Colonel <span lang="fr">Huguet</span>, a well-known French Artillery Officer who had
recently been for several years French Military Attaché in London.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, one of the most important matters remaining for
discussion and decision was finally to determine whether the original
plan as regards the area of concentration for the British Forces in
France was to be adhered to, or whether the actual situation demanded
some change or modification. There was an exhaustive exchange of views
between soldiers and Ministers, and many conflicting opinions were
expressed. The soldiers themselves were not agreed. Lord Kitchener
thought that our position on the left of the French line at <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>
would be too exposed, and rather favoured a concentration farther back
in the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Amiens</span>. Sir Douglas Haig suggested postponing
any landing till the campaign had actively opened and we should be
able to judge in which direction our co-operation would be most
effective.</p>

<p>Personally, I was opposed to these ideas, and most anxious to adhere
to our original plans. Any alteration in carrying out our
concentration, particularly if this meant delay, would have upset the
French plan of campaign <span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> and created much distrust in the
minds of our Allies. Delay or hanging back would not only have looked
like hesitation, but might easily have entailed disastrous
consequences by permanently separating our already inferior forces.
Having regard to what we subsequently knew of the German plans and
preparations, there can be no doubt that any such delayed landing
might well have been actively opposed. As will be seen hereafter, we
were at first hopeful of carrying out a successful offensive, and, had
those hopes been justified, any change or delay in our original plans
would have either prevented or entirely paralysed it. The vital
element of the problem was speed in mobilisation and concentration,
change of plans meant inevitable and possibly fatal delay.</p>

<p>Murray, Wilson, Grierson and <span lang="fr">Huguet</span> concurred in my views, and it was
so settled.</p>

<p>The date of the embarkment of the Headquarters Staff was fixed for
Friday, August 14th.</p>

<p>During the fateful days which intervened, daily and almost hourly
reports reached us as to the progress of mobilisation both of our
Allies and our Enemies. From the first it became quite evident that
the German system of mobilisation was quicker than the French. There
was reason to believe that Germany had partly mobilised some classes
of her reserves before formal mobilisation. The splendid stand made by
the Belgians in defence of their frontier fortresses is well known,
and the course of the preliminary operations on the Belgian and
Luxemburg frontiers, as well as those in the neighbourhood of Nancy,
gave us hope that the wonderful army of which we had heard so much,
was not altogether the absolutely invincible war machine we had been
led to expect and believe. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> During this most critical time,
my mind was occupied day and night with anxious thought. I will try to
recall those days of the first half of August, 1914, and crystallise
the result of my meditations. This will serve to show the doubts,
fears, hopes and aspirations, in short the mental atmosphere in which
I awaited the opening of the campaign.</p>

<p>In the ten years previous to the War, I had constantly envisaged the
probable course of events leading up to the outbreak of this
world-war, as well as the manner of the outbreak itself. In
imagination I had seen the spark suddenly emitted in some obscure
corner of Europe, followed by the blowing-up of one huge magazine,
such as the declaration of war between Russia and Austria would prove
to be, then the conflagration spreading with lightning speed, and I
had seemed to have a foretaste amid it all of the anxious hesitation
which would precede our entry into the war.</p>

<p>I have been a member of the Committee of Imperial Defence since 1906,
and have assisted at the innumerable deliberations of that Aulic
Council. It was somewhere about 1908 that the certainty of a war was
forced upon my mind. Lord Haldane was then Secretary of State for War
and I was Inspector-General of the Forces. Lord Haldane was himself
alive to the possibility of war; but, while he hoped to ward it off by
diplomacy and negotiation, he fully acquiesced in the desirability of
making every preparation which could be carried out in complete
secrecy. He told me that were he in power, if and when the event
occurred, he would designate me to command the Expeditionary Force,
and requested me to study the problem carefully and do all I could to
be ready. It thus fell out that in August, 1914, the many
possibilities and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> alternatives of action were quite familiar
to my mind.</p>

<p>It is now within the knowledge of all that the General Staffs of Great
Britain and France had, for a long time, held conferences, and that a
complete mutual understanding as to combined action in certain
eventualities existed.</p>

<p>Belgium, however, remained a "dark horse" up to the last, and it is
most unfortunate that she could never be persuaded to decide upon her
attitude in the event of a general war. All we ever had in our mind
was <span class="italic">defence</span> against attack by Germany. We had guaranteed the
neutrality of Belgium, and all reports pointed to an intention by
Germany to violate that neutrality. What we desired above all things
was that Belgium should realise the danger which subsequently laid her
waste. We were anxious that she should assist and co-operate in her
own defence. The idea of <span class="italic">attacking</span> Germany through Belgium or in any
other direction never entered our heads.</p>

<p>Pre-war arrangements like these were bound in such circumstances to be
very imperfect, though infinitely better than none at all.</p>

<p>It will be of interest at this point to narrate a conversation I had
with the Emperor William in August, 1911. When His Majesty visited
this country in the spring of that year to unveil the statue of Queen
Victoria, he invited me to be his guest at the grand cavalry
man&oelig;uvres to be held that summer in the neighbourhood of Berlin.</p>

<p>It was an experience I shall never forget, and it impressed me
enormously with the efficiency and power of the German cavalry. It was
on about the third day of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> the man&oelig;uvres that the Emperor
arrived by train at five in the morning to find the troops drawn up on
the plain close by to receive him. I have never seen a more
magnificent military spectacle than they presented on that brilliant
August morning, numbering some 15,000 horsemen with a large force of
horse artillery, <span lang="de">jäger</span> and machine guns.</p>

<p>When His Majesty had finished the inspection of the line, and the
troops had moved to take up their points for man&oelig;uvre, the Emperor
sent for me. He was very pleasant and courteous, asked me if I was
made comfortable, and if I had got a good horse. He then went on to
say that he knew all our sympathies in Great Britain were with France
and against Germany. He said he wished me to see everything that could
be seen, but told me he trusted to my honour to reveal nothing if I
visited France.</p>

<p>After the man&oelig;uvres of the day were completed, at about 11 or 12
o'clock, I was placed next to His Majesty at luncheon and we had
another conversation. He asked me what I thought of what I had seen in
the morning and told me that the German cavalry was the most perfect
in the world; but he added: "It is not only the Cavalry; the
Artillery, the Infantry, all the arms of the Service are equally
efficient. The sword of Germany is sharp; and if you oppose Germany
you will find how sharp it is."</p>

<p>Before I left, His Majesty was kind enough to present me with his
photograph beautifully framed. Pointing to it, he remarked,
semi-jocularly: "There is your archenemy! There is your disturber of
the peace of Europe!"</p>

<p>Reverting to my story. Personally, I had always thought that Germany
would violate Belgian neutrality, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> in no such half
measure as by a march through the <span lang="fr">Ardennes</span>, which was what our joint
plans mainly contemplated. I felt convinced that if ever she took this
drastic step, she would make the utmost use of it to pour over the
whole country and outflank the Allies.</p>

<p>The principal source of the terrible anxiety I felt took its root in
the thought that we were too much mentally committed to meet an attack
from the east, instead of one which was to come as it actually did. It
reassured me, however, to know that our actual dispositions did not
preclude the possibility of stemming the first outburst of the storm
so effectively as to ward off any imminent danger which might threaten
Northern France and the Channel Ports.</p>

<p>To turn from the province of strategy to the sphere of tactics, a
life-long experience of military study and thought had taught me that
the principle of the tactical employment of troops must be
instinctive. I knew that in putting the science of war into practice,
it was necessary that its main tenets should form, so to speak, part
of one's flesh and blood. In war there is little time to think, and
the right thing to do must come like a flash&mdash;it must present itself
to the mind as perfectly <span class="italic">obvious</span>.</p>

<p>No previous experience, no conclusion I had been able to draw from
campaigns in which I had taken part, or from a close study of the new
conditions in which the war of to-day is waged, had led me to
anticipate a war of positions. All my thoughts, all my prospective
plans, all my possible alternatives of action, were concentrated upon
a war of movement and man&oelig;uvre. I knew perfectly well that modern
up-to-date inventions would materially influence and modify our
previous conceptions as to the employment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> of the three arms
respectively; but I had not realised that this process would work in
so drastic a manner as to render all our preconceived ideas of the
method of tactical field operations comparatively ineffective and
useless. Judged by the course of events in the first three weeks of
the War, neither French nor German generals were prepared for the
complete transformation of all military ideas which the development of
the operations inevitably demonstrated to be imperative for waging war
in present conditions.</p>

<p>It is easy to be "wise after the event"; but I cannot help wondering
why none of us realised what the most modern rifle, the machine gun,
motor traction, the aeroplane and wireless telegraphy would bring
about. It seems so simple when judged by actual results. The modern
rifle and machine gun add tenfold to the relative power of the defence
as against the attack. This precludes the use of the old methods of
attack, and has driven the attack to seek covered entrenchments after
every forward rush of at most a few hundred yards.</p>

<p>It has thus become a practical operation to place the heaviest
artillery in position close behind the infantry fighting line, not
only owing to the mobility afforded by motor traction but also because
the old dread of losing the guns before they could be got away no
longer exists. The crucial necessity for the effective employment of
heavy artillery is observation, and this is provided by the balloon
and the aeroplane, which, by means of wireless telegraphy, can keep
the batteries instantly informed of the accuracy of their fire.</p>

<p>I feel sure in my own mind that had we realised the true effect of
modern appliances of war in August, 1914, there would have been no
retreat from <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, and that if, in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> September, the Germans
had learnt their lesson, the Allies would never have driven them back
to the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>. It was in the fighting on that river that the eyes of
all of us began to be opened.</p>

<p>New characteristics of offensive and defensive war began vaguely to be
appreciated; but it required the successive attempts of <span lang="fr">Maunoury, de
Castelnau, Foch</span> and myself to turn the German flanks in the north in
the old approved style, and the practical failure of these attempts,
to bring home to our minds the true nature of war as it is to-day.</p>

<p>About the middle of November, 1914&mdash;after three and a half months of
war&mdash;we were fairly settled down to the war of positions.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, in a somewhat troubled frame of mind that I began
to play my humble part in this tremendous episode in the history of
the world. The new lessons had to be learned in a hard school and
through a bitter experience. However, for good or for evil, I have
always been possessed of a sanguine temperament. No one, I felt, had
really been able to gauge the respective fighting values of the French
and German Armies. I hoped for the best and rather believed in it; and
in this confident spirit, although anxious and watchful, I landed at
<span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> at 5 p.m. on August 14th, 1914.</p>

<p>It will be a fitting close to this chapter if I add the instructions
which I received from His Majesty's Government before leaving.</p>

<p>"Owing to the infringement of the neutrality of Belgium by Germany,
and in furtherance of the Entente which exists between this country
and France, His Majesty's Government has decided, at the request of
the French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> Government, to send an Expeditionary Force to
France and to entrust the command of the troops to yourself.</p>

<p>"The special motive of the Force under your control is to support and
co-operate with the French Army against our common enemies. The
peculiar task laid upon you is to assist the French Government in
preventing or repelling the invasion by Germany of French and Belgian
territory and eventually to restore the neutrality of Belgium, on
behalf of which, as guaranteed by treaty, Belgium has appealed to the
French and to ourselves.</p>

<p>"These are the reasons which have induced His Majesty's Government to
declare war, and these reasons constitute the primary objective you
have before you.</p>

<p>"The place of your assembly, according to present arrangements, is
<span lang="fr">Amiens</span>, and during the assembly of your troops you will have every
opportunity for discussing with the Commander-in-Chief of the French
Army, the military position in general and the special part which your
Force is able and adapted to play. It must be recognised from the
outset that the numerical strength of the British Force and its
contingent reinforcement is strictly limited, and with this
consideration kept steadily in view it will be obvious that the
greatest care must be exercised towards a minimum of losses and
wastage.</p>

<p>"Therefore, while every effort must be made to coincide most
sympathetically with the plans and wishes of our Ally, the gravest
consideration will devolve upon you as to participation in forward
movements where large bodies of French troops are not engaged and
where your Force may be unduly exposed to attack. Should a contingency
of this sort be contemplated, I look to you to inform me fully and
give me time to communicate to you <span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span> any decision to which His
Majesty's Government may come in the matter. In this connection I wish
you distinctly to understand that your command is an entirely
independent one, and that you will in no case come in any sense under
the orders of any Allied General.</p>

<p>"In minor operations you should be careful that your subordinates
understand that risk of serious losses should only be taken where such
risk is authoritatively considered to be commensurate with the object
in view.</p>

<p>"The high courage and discipline of your troops should, and certainly
will, have fair and full opportunity of display during the campaign,
but officers may well be reminded that in this, their first experience
of European warfare, a greater measure of caution must be employed
than under former conditions of hostilities against an untrained
adversary.</p>

<p>"You will kindly keep up constant communication with the War Office,
and you will be good enough to inform me as to all movements of the
enemy reported to you as well as to those of the French Army.</p>

<p>"I am sure you fully realise that you can rely with the utmost
confidence on the wholehearted and unswerving support of the
Government, of myself, and of your compatriots, in carrying out the
high duty which the King has entrusted to you and in maintaining the
great tradition of His Majesty's Army.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE</h4>


<p>I have thought fit to interrupt my narrative here to devote some pages
to the composition of the original Expeditionary Force. The First
Expeditionary Force consisted of the First Army Corps (1st and 2nd
Divisions) under <abbr title="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-Gen.</abbr> Sir Douglas Haig; the Second Army Corps
(3rd and 5th Divisions) under <abbr title="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-Gen.</abbr> Sir James Grierson (who died
shortly after landing in France and was succeeded by <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Sir Horace
Smith-Dorrien), and the Cavalry Division under <abbr title="Major-General">Major-Gen.</abbr> E. H. H.
Allenby. To these must be added the 19th Infantry Brigade, which, at
the opening of our operations in France, was employed on our Lines of
Communication. The original Expeditionary Force was subsequently
augmented by the 4th Division, which detrained at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> on August
25th. The 4th Division and the 19th Infantry Brigade were, on the
arrival of <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Pulteney in France, on August 30th, formed into the
Third Army Corps, to which the 6th Division was subsequently added.</p>

<p>For the purpose of convenient reference, I have included in this
chapter the composition of the 6th Division, which joined us on the
<span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, and of the 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division, which
came into line with the original Expeditionary Force in Belgium in the
opening stages of the First Battle of Ypres; as also of the Lahore
Division of the Indian Corps, which likewise took part in the Battle
of Ypres.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span></h3>

<h4>THE SAILING OF THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE</h4>

<p>I left Charing Cross by special train at 2 p.m. on Friday, August
14th, and embarked at Dover in His Majesty's cruiser "Sentinel." Sir
Maurice FitzGerald and a few other friends were at the station to see
me off, and I was accompanied by Murray, Wilson, Robertson, Lambton,
Wake, <span lang="fr">Huguet</span> and Brinsley FitzGerald (my private secretary). The day
was dark, dull and gloomy, and rather chilly for August. Dover had
ceased to be the cheery seaside resort of peace days, and had assumed
the appearance of a fortress expecting momentary attack. Very few
people were about, and the place was prepared for immediate action.
The fine harbour was crowded with destroyers, submarines, and a few
cruisers; booms barred all the entrances and mines were laid down.</p>

<p>It was the first time since war had been declared that I witnessed the
outward and visible signs of the great struggle for which we were
girding our loins. Not the least evidence of this was the appearance
of the officers and men of the "Sentinel." All showed in their faces
that strained, eager, watchful look which told of the severe and
continual daily and nightly vigil. This was very marked, and much
impressed me.</p>

<p>We sailed a little before 4 and landed at <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> about 5.30 in the
evening. I was met by the Governor, the Commandant, and the port
officials, and we had a very hearty reception. There were several rest
camps at <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> and I was able to visit them. Officers
and men looked fit and well, and were full of enthusiasm and cheer.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> was only a secondary port of embarkation, but I can vividly
recall the scene. Everyone knows the curious and interesting old town,
with its picturesque citadel, situated on a lofty hill. On all sides
were evidences of great activity and excitement. Soldiers and sailors,
both British and French, were everywhere. All were being warmly
welcomed and cheered by the townspeople.</p>

<p>The declining August sun lit up sinuous columns of infantry ascending
the high ground to their rest camps on the plateau to the sound of
military bands. From the heights above the town, the quays and
wharves, where the landing of troops and stores was unceasingly going
forward, looked like human beehives. Looking out to sea, one could
distinguish approaching transports here and there between the ever
wary and watchful scout, destroyer and submarine, which were jealously
guarding the route.</p>

<p>Over all towered the monument to the greatest world-soldier&mdash;the
warrior Emperor who, more than a hundred years before, had from that
spot contemplated the invasion of England. Could he have now revisited
"the glimpses of the moon," would he not have rejoiced at this
friendly invasion of France by England's "good yeomen," who were now
offering their lives to save France from possible destruction as a
Power of the first class? It was a wonderful and never to be forgotten
scene in the setting sun; and, as I walked round camps and bivouacs, I
could not but think of the many fine fellows around me who had said
good-bye to Old England for ever.</p>

<p>We left <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> at 7.20 the same evening, and reached <span lang="fr">Amiens</span> at 9.
There I was met by General Robert (Military Governor) and his staff,
the Prefect and officials. <span lang="fr">Amiens</span> was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> the Headquarters of
General Robb, the Commander of our Line of Communications, and it was
also the first point of concentration for our aircraft, which David
Henderson commanded, with Sykes as his chief assistant. Whilst at
<span lang="fr">Amiens</span> I was able to hold important discussions with Robb and
Henderson as to their respective commands.</p>

<p>I left <span lang="fr">Amiens</span> for Paris on the morning of the 15th and we reached the
Nord Terminus at 12.45 p.m., where I was met by the British Ambassador
(now Lord Bertie) and the Military Governor of Paris. Large crowds had
assembled in the streets on the way to the Embassy, and we were
received with tremendous greetings by the people. Their welcome was
cordial in the extreme. The day is particularly memorable to me,
because my previous acquaintance with Lord Bertie ripened from that
time into an intimate friendship to which I attach the greatest value.
I trust that, when the real history of this war is written, the
splendid part played by this great Ambassador may be thoroughly
understood and appreciated by his countrymen. Throughout the year and
a half that I commanded in France, his help and counsel were
invaluable to me.</p>

<p>We drove to the Embassy and lunched there. In the afternoon,
accompanied by the Ambassador, I visited M. <span lang="fr">Poincaré</span>. The President
was attended by M. Viviani, Prime Minister, and M. Messimy, Minister
for War. The situation was fully discussed, and I was much impressed
by the optimistic spirit of the President. I am sure he had formed
great hopes of a victorious advance by the Allies from the line they
had taken up, and he discoursed playfully with me on the possibility
of another battle being fought by the British on the old field of
Waterloo. He said the attitude of the French nation was admirable,
that they were very calm and determined.</p>

<p>After <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> leaving the President I went to the War Office. Maps
were produced; the whole situation was again discussed, and
arrangements were made for me to meet General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> at his
Headquarters the next day.</p>

<p>In the evening I dined quietly with Brinsley FitzGerald at the Ritz,
and here it was curious to observe how Paris, like Dover, had put on a
sombre garb of war. The buoyant, optimistic nature of the French
people was apparent in the few we met; but there was no bombastic,
over-confident tone in the conversation around us; only a quiet, but
grim, determination which fully appreciated the tremendous
difficulties and gigantic issues at stake. The false optimism of "À
Berlin" associated with 1870 was conspicuously absent. In its place, a
silent determination to fight to the last franc and to the last man.</p>

<p>We left Paris by motor early on the 16th, and arrived at <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s
Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Vitry-le-François</span> at noon. A few minutes before our
arrival a captured German flag (the first visible trophy of war I had
seen) had been brought in, and the impression of General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> which
was left on my mind was that he possessed a fund of human
understanding and sympathy.</p>

<p>I had heard of the French Commander-in-Chief for years, but had never
before seen him. He struck me at once as a man of strong will and
determination, very courteous and considerate, but firm and steadfast
of mind and purpose, and not easily turned or persuaded. He appeared
to me to be capable of exercising a powerful influence over the troops
he commanded and as likely to enjoy their confidence.</p>

<p>These were all "first impressions"; but I may say here that everything
I then thought of General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> was far more than confirmed
throughout the year and a half of fierce <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> struggle during
which I was associated with him. His steadfastness and determination,
his courage and patience, were tried to the utmost and never found
wanting. History will rank him as one of the supremely great leaders.
The immediate task before him was stupendous, and nobly did he arise
to it.</p>

<p>I was quite favourably impressed by General <span lang="fr">Berthelot</span> (<span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s Chief
of Staff) and all the Staff Officers I met, and was much struck by
their attitude and bearing. There was a complete absence of fuss, and
a calm, deliberate confidence was manifest everywhere. I had a long
conversation with the Commander-in-Chief, at which General <span lang="fr">Berthelot</span>
was present. He certainly never gave me the slightest reason to
suppose that any idea of "retirement" was in his mind. He discussed
possible alternatives of action depending upon the information
received of the enemy's plans and dispositions; but his main intention
was always to attack.</p>

<p>There were two special points in this conversation which recur to my
mind.</p>

<p>As the British Army was posted on the left, or exposed flank, I asked
<span lang="fr">Joffre</span> to place the French Cavalry Division, and two Reserve Divisions
which were echeloned in reserve behind, directly under my orders. This
the Commander-in-Chief found himself unable to concede.</p>

<p>The second point I recall is the high esteem in which the General
Commanding the 5th French Army, General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>, which was posted on
my immediate right, was held by <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and his Staff. He was
represented to me as the best Commander in the French Army, on whose
complete support and skilful co-operation I could thoroughly rely.</p>

<p>Before leaving, the Commander-in-Chief handed me a written <span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span>
memorandum setting forth his views as he had stated them to me,
accompanied by a short appreciation of the situation made by the Chief
of the General Staff.</p>

<p>We motored to Rheims, where we slept that night. Throughout this long
motor journey we passed through great areas of cultivated country. All
work, it seemed, had ceased; the crops were half cut, and stooks of
corn were lying about everywhere. It was difficult to imagine how the
harvest would be saved; but one of my most extraordinary experiences
in France was to watch the farming and agriculture going on as if by
magic. When, how, or by whom it was done, has always been an enigma to
me. There can be no doubt that the women and children proved an
enormous help to their country in these directions. Their share of the
victory should never be forgotten. It has been distilled from their
sweat and tears.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th I went to Rethel, which was the
Headquarters of the General Commanding the 5th French Army. Having
heard such eulogies of him at French <abbr title="general headquarter">G.H.Q.</abbr>, my first impressions of
General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> were probably coloured and modified in his favour;
but, looking back, I remember that his personality did not convey to
me the idea of a great leader. He was a big man with a loud voice, and
his manner did not strike me as being very courteous.</p>

<p>When he was discussing the situation, his attitude might have made a
casual observer credit him with practical powers of command and
determination of character; but, for my own part, I seemed to detect,
from the first time my eyes fell upon him, a certain over-confidence
which appeared to ignore the necessity for any consideration of
alternatives. Although we arrived at a mutual understanding which
included no idea or thought of "retreat," I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> left General
<span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>'s Headquarters believing that the Commander-in-Chief had
over-rated his ability; and I was therefore not surprised when he
afterwards turned out to be the most complete example, amongst the
many this War has afforded, of the Staff College "pedant," whose
"superior education" had given him little idea of how to conduct war.</p>

<p>On leaving Rethel, I motored to <span lang="fr">Vervins</span>, where I interviewed the
Commanders of the French Reserve Divisions in my immediate
neighbourhood, and reached my Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> late in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>The first news I got was of the sudden death of my dear old friend and
comrade, Jimmie Grierson (General Sir James Grierson, Commanding the
2nd Army Corps). He was taken ill quite suddenly in the train on his
way to his own Corps Headquarters, and died in a few minutes. I had
known him for many years, but since 1906 had been quite closely
associated with him; for he had taken a leading part in the
preparation of the Army for war throughout that time. He possessed a
wonderful personality, and was justly beloved by officers and men
alike. He was able to get the best work out of them, and they would
follow him anywhere. He had been British Military <span lang="fr">Attaché</span> in Berlin
for some years, and had thus acquired an intimate knowledge of the
German Army. An excellent linguist, he spoke French with ease and
fluency, and he used to astonish French soldiers by his intimate
knowledge of the history of their regiments, which was often far in
excess of what they knew themselves. His military acquirements were
brilliant, and in every respect thoroughly up-to-date. Apart from the
real affection I always felt for him, I regarded his loss as a great
calamity in the conduct of the campaign.</p>

<p>His <span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> place was taken by Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, although I
asked that Sir Herbert Plumer might be sent out to me to succeed
Grierson in command of the 2nd Corps. As a matter of fact, the
question of Sir James Grierson's successor was not referred to me at
all. The appointment was made at home. Although I knew Sir Horace to
be a soldier who had done good service and possessed a fine record, I
had asked for Sir Herbert Plumer because I felt he was the right man
for this command.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener had asked me to send him a statement of the French
dispositions west of the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>. I sent him this in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left50">"Headquarters,<br>
<span class="left15" lang="fr">"Le Cateau,</span><br>
<span class="left30">"August 17th, 1914.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Lord K.</span></p>

<p>"With reference to your wire asking for information as to the position
of French troops west of the line <span lang="fr">Givet&mdash;Dinant&mdash;Namur</span>&mdash;Brussels, I
have already replied by wire in general terms. I now send full
details.</p>

<p>"A Corps of Cavalry (three divisions less one brigade), supported by
some Infantry, is north of the River <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> between <span lang="fr">Charleroi</span> and
<span lang="fr">Namur</span>. This is the nearest French force to the Belgian Army, and I do
not know if and where they have established communication with them,
nor do the French.</p>

<p>"One French Corps, with an added Infantry Brigade and a Cavalry
Brigade, is guarding the River <span lang="fr">Meuse</span> from <span lang="fr">Givet</span> to <span lang="fr">Namur</span>. The bridges
are mined and ready to be blown up.</p>

<p>"In rear of this corps, two more corps are moving&mdash;one on
<span lang="fr">Philippeville</span>, the other on <span lang="fr">Beaumont</span>. Each of these two corps is
composed of three divisions. In rear of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> them a fourth corps
assembles to-morrow west of <span lang="fr">Beaumont</span>. Three Reserve divisions are
already in waiting between <span lang="fr">Vervins</span> and <span lang="fr">Hirson</span>. Another Reserve
division is guarding the almost impassable country between <span lang="fr">Givet</span> and
<span lang="fr">Mézières</span>.</p>

<p>"Finally, other Reserve formations are guarding the frontier between
<span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> and <span lang="fr">Lille</span>.</p>

<p>"I left Paris on Sunday morning (16th) by motor, and reached the
Headquarters of General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> (French Commander-in-Chief) at 12. They
are at <span lang="fr">Vitry-le-François</span>. He quite realises the importance and value
of adopting a waiting attitude. In the event of a forward movement by
the German Corps in the <span lang="fr">Ardennes</span> and Luxemburg, he is anxious that I
should act in echelon on the left of the 5th French Army, whose
present disposition I have stated above. The French Cavalry Corps now
north of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> will operate on my left front and keep touch with
the Belgians.</p>

<p>"I spent the night at Rheims and motored this morning to Rethel, the
Headquarters of General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>, Commander 5th French Army. I had a
long talk with him and arranged for co-operation in all alternative
circumstances.</p>

<p>"I then came on to my Headquarters at this place where I found
everything proceeding satisfactorily and up to time. I was much
shocked to hear of Grierson's sudden death near <span lang="fr">Amiens</span> when I arrived
here. I had already wired asking you to appoint Plumer in his place,
when your wire reached me and also that of Ian Hamilton, forwarded&mdash;as
I understand&mdash;by you. I very much hope you will send me Plumer;
Hamilton is too senior to command an Army Corps and is already engaged
in an important command at home.</p>

<p>"Please <span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> do as I ask you in this matter? I needn't assure you
there was no 'promise' of any kind.</p>

<p class="left50"><span class="left15">"Yours sincerely,</span><br>
  "(Signed)<span class="add2em"><span class="smcap">J. D. P. French</span>.</span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I am much impressed by all I have seen of the French General
Staff. They are very deliberate, calm, and confident. There was a
total absence of fuss and confusion, and a determination to give only
a just and proper value to any reported successes. So far there has
been no conflict of first-rate importance, but there has been enough
fighting to justify a hope that the French artillery is superior to
the German."</p>

<p>It was on Tuesday, August 18th, that I was first able to assemble the
Corps Commanders and their Staffs. Their reports as to the transport
of their troops from their mobilising stations to France were highly
satisfactory.</p>

<p>The nation owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Naval Transport
Service and to all concerned in the embarking and disembarking of the
Expeditionary Force. Every move was carried out exactly to time, and
the concentration of the British Army on the left of the French was
effected in such a manner as to enable every unit to obtain the
requisite time to familiarise troops with active service conditions,
before it became necessary to make severe demands upon their strength
and endurance.</p>

<p>My discussion with the Corps Commanders was based upon the following
brief appreciation of the situation on that day. This was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Between <span lang="fr">Tirlemont</span> (to the east of <span lang="fr">Louvain</span>) and <span lang="fr">Metz</span>, the enemy has
some 13 to 15 Army Corps and seven Cavalry Divisions. A certain number
of reserve troops are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> said to be engaged in the offensive of
<span lang="fr">Liége</span>, the forts of which place are believed to be still intact,
although some of the enemy's troops hold the town.</p>

<p>"These German Corps are in two main groups, seven to eight Corps and
four Cavalry Divisions being between <span lang="fr">Tirlemont</span> and <span lang="fr">Givet</span>. Six to seven
Corps and three Cavalry Divisions are in Belgian Luxemburg.</p>

<p>"Of the northern group, it is believed that the greater part&mdash;perhaps
five Corps&mdash;are either north and west of the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>, or being pushed
across by bridges at <span lang="fr">Huy</span> and elsewhere.</p>

<p>"The general direction of the German advance is by <span lang="fr">Waremme</span> on
<span lang="fr">Tirlemont</span>. Two German Cavalry Divisions which crossed the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span> some
days ago have reached <span lang="fr">Gembloux</span>, but have been driven back to Mont
Arden by French cavalry supported by a mixed Belgian brigade.</p>

<p>"The German plans are still rather uncertain, but it is confidently
believed that at least five Army Corps and two or three Cavalry
Divisions will move against the French frontiers south-west, on a
great line between Brussels and <span lang="fr">Givet</span>.</p>

<p>"The 1st French Corps is now at <span lang="fr">Dinant</span>, one Infantry and one Cavalry
Brigade opposing the group of German Corps south of the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>.</p>

<p>"The 10th and 3rd Corps are on the line <span lang="fr">Rethel&mdash;Thuin</span>, south of the
<span lang="fr">Sambre</span>. The 18th Corps are moving up on the left of the 10th and 3rd.</p>

<p>"Six or seven Reserve French Divisions are entrenched on a line
reaching from Dunkirk, on the coast, through <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> and <span lang="fr">La Capelle</span>,
to <span lang="fr">Hirson</span>.</p>

<p>"The Belgian Army is entrenched on a line running north-east and
south-west through <span lang="fr">Louvain</span>."</p>

<p>My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> general instructions were then communicated to Corps
Commanders as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When our concentration is complete, it is intended that we should
operate on the left of the French 5th Army, the 18th Corps being on
our right. The French Cavalry Corps of three divisions will be on our
left and in touch with the Belgians.</p>

<p>"As a preliminary to this, we shall take up an area north of the
<span lang="fr">Sambre</span>, and on Monday the heads of the Allied columns should be on the
line <span lang="fr">Mons&mdash;Givet</span>, with the cavalry on the outer flank.</p>

<p>"Should the German attack develop in the manner expected, we shall
advance on the general line <span lang="fr">Mons&mdash;Dinant</span> to meet it."</p>

<p>During these first days, whilst our concentration was in course of
completion, I rode about a great deal amongst the troops, which were
generally on the move to take up their billets or doing practice route
marches. I had an excellent opportunity of observing the physique and
general appearance of the men. Many of the reservists at first bore
traces of the civilian life which they had just left, and presented an
anxious, tired appearance; but it was wonderful to observe the almost
hourly improvement which took place amongst them. I knew that, under
the supervision and influence of the magnificent body of officers and
non-commissioned officers which belonged to the 1st Expeditionary
Force, all the reservists, even those who had been for years away from
the colours, would, before going under fire, regain to the full the
splendid military vigour, determination, and spirit which has at all
times been so marked a characteristic of British soldiers in the
field.</p>

<p>I received a pressing request from the King of the Belgians <span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span>
to visit His Majesty at his Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Louvain</span>; but the immediate
course of the operations prevented me from doing so.</p>

<p>The opening phases of the Battle of <span lang="fr">Mons</span> did not commence until the
morning of Saturday, August 22nd. Up to that time, so far as the
British forces were concerned, the forwarding of offensive operations
had complete possession of our minds. During the days which
intervened, I had frequent meetings and discussions with the Corps and
Cavalry Commanders. The Intelligence Reports which constantly arrived,
and the results of cavalry and aircraft reconnaissances, only
confirmed the previous appreciation of the situation, and left no
doubt as to the direction of the German advance; but nothing came to
hand which led us to foresee the crushing superiority of strength
which actually confronted us on Sunday, August 23rd.</p>

<p>This was our first practical experience in the use of aircraft for
reconnaissance purposes. It cannot be said that in these early days of
the fighting the cavalry entirely abandoned that <span class="italic">rôle</span>. On the
contrary, they furnished me with much useful information.</p>

<p>The number of our aeroplanes was then limited, and their powers of
observation were not so developed or so accurate as they afterwards
became. Nevertheless, they kept close touch with the enemy, and their
reports proved of the greatest value.</p>

<p>Whilst at this time, as I have said, aircraft did not altogether
replace cavalry as regards the gaining and collection of information,
yet, by working together as they did, the two arms gained much more
accurate and voluminous knowledge of the situation. It was, indeed,
the timely warning they gave which chiefly enabled me to make speedy
dispositions to avert danger and disaster.</p>

<p>There <span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span> can be no doubt indeed that, even then, the presence
and co-operation of aircraft saved the very frequent use of small
cavalry patrols and detached supports. This enabled the latter arm to
save horseflesh and concentrate their power more on actual combat and
fighting, and to this is greatly due the marked success which attended
the operations of the cavalry during the Battle of <span lang="fr">Mons</span> and the
subsequent retreat.</p>

<p>At the time I am writing, however, it would appear that the duty of
collecting information and maintaining touch with an enemy in the
field will in future fall entirely upon the air service, which will
set the cavalry free for different but equally important work.</p>

<p>I had daily consultations with Sir William Robertson, the
Quartermaster-General. He expressed himself as well satisfied with the
condition of the transport, both horse and mechanical, although he
said the civilian drivers were giving a little trouble at first.
Munitions and supplies were well provided for, and there were at least
1,000 rounds per gun and 800 rounds per rifle. We also discussed the
arrangements for the evacuation of wounded.</p>

<p>The immediate despatch from home of the 4th Division was now decided
upon and had commenced, and I received sanction to form a 19th Brigade
of Infantry from the Line of Communication battalions.</p>

<p>At this time I received some interesting reports as to the work of the
French cavalry in Belgium. Their <span class="italic">morale</span> was high and they were very
efficient. They were opposed by two divisions of German cavalry whose
patrols, they said, showed great want of dash and initiative, and were
not well supported. They formed the opinion that the German horse did
not care about trying conclusions mounted, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> but endeavoured
to draw the French under the fire of artillery and <span lang="de">jäger</span> battalions,
the last-named always accompanying a German Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>At 5.30 a.m. on the 21st I received a visit from General <span lang="fr">de
Morionville</span>, Chief of the Staff to His Majesty the King of the
Belgians, who, with a small staff, was proceeding to <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s
Headquarters. The General showed signs of the terrible ordeal through
which he and his gallant army had passed since the enemy had so
grossly violated Belgian territory. He confirmed all the reports we
had received concerning the situation generally, and added that the
unsupported condition of the Belgian Army rendered their position very
precarious, and that the King had, therefore, determined to effect a
retirement on Antwerp, where they would be prepared to attack the
flank of the enemy's columns as they advanced. He told me he hoped to
arrive at a complete understanding with the French Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>On this day, August 21st, the Belgians evacuated Brussels and were
retiring on Antwerp, and I received the following message from the
Government:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Belgian Government desire to assure the British and French
Governments of the unreserved support of the Belgian Army on the left
flank of the Allied Armies with the whole of its troops and all
available resources, wherever their line of communications with the
base at Antwerp, where all their ammunition and food supplies are
kept, is not in danger of being severed by large hostile forces.</p>

<p>"Within the above-mentioned limits the Allied Armies may continue to
rely on the co-operation of the Belgian troops.</p>

<p>"Since the commencement of hostilities the Field Army has been holding
the line <span lang="fr">Tirlemont&mdash;Jodoigne&mdash;Hammemille&mdash;Louvain</span>, where, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> up
to the 18th August, it has been standing by, hoping for the active
co-operation of the Allied Army.</p>

<p>"On August 18th it was decided that the Belgian Army, consisting of
50,000 Infantry rifles, 276 guns, and 4,100 Cavalry should retreat on
the Dyle. This step was taken owing to the fact that the support of
the Allies had not yet been effective, and, moreover, that the Belgian
forces were menaced by three Army Corps and three Cavalry Divisions
(the greater part of the First Army of the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>), who threatened to
cut their communications with their base.</p>

<p>"The rearguard of the 1st Division of the Army having been forced to
retire after a fierce engagement lasting five or six hours on August
18th, and the Commander of the Division having stated that his troops
were not in a fit state to withstand a long engagement owing to the
loss of officers and the weariness of the men; and, moreover, as the
Commander of the 3rd Division of the Army, which was so sorely tried
at <span lang="fr">Liége</span>, had similarly come to the conclusion, on August 19th, that
the defence of the Dyle was becoming very dangerous, more especially
in view of the turning movement of the 2nd Army Corps and 2nd Cavalry
Division, it was definitely decided to retreat under the protection of
the forts at Antwerp.</p>

<p>"The general idea is now that the Field Army, in part or as a whole,
should issue from Antwerp as soon as circumstances seem to favour such
a movement.</p>

<p>"In this event, the Army will try to co-operate in its movements with
the Allies as circumstances may dictate."</p>

<p>Exhaustive reconnaissances and intelligence reports admitted of no
doubt that the enemy was taking the fullest advantage of his violation
of Belgian territory, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> that he was protected to the right
of his advance, at least as far west as <span lang="fr">Soignies</span> and <span lang="fr">Nivelles</span>, whence
he was moving direct upon the British and 5th French Armies.</p>

<p>In further proof that, at this time, no idea of retreat was in the
minds of the leaders of the Allied Armies, I received late on Friday,
the 21st, General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>'s orders to his troops. All his corps were
in position south of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>, and he was only waiting the
development of a move by the 3rd and 4th French Armies from the line
<span lang="fr">Mézières</span>&mdash;Longwy to begin his own advance.</p>

<p>As regards our own troops, on the evening of the 21st, the cavalry,
under Allenby, were holding the line of the <span lang="fr">Condé</span> Canal with four
brigades. Two brigades of horse artillery were in reserve at
<span lang="fr">Harmignies</span>. The 5th Cavalry Brigade, under Chetwode, composed of the
Scots Greys, 12th Lancers, and 20th Hussars, were at <span lang="fr">Binche</span>, in touch
with the French.</p>

<p>Reconnoitring squadrons and patrols were pushed out towards <span lang="fr">Soignies</span>
and <span lang="fr">Nivelles</span>.</p>

<p>I visited Allenby's Headquarters in the afternoon of the 21st, and
discussed the situation with him. I told him on no account to commit
the cavalry to any engagement of importance, but to draw off towards
our left flank when pressed by the enemy's columns, and there remain
in readiness for action and reconnoitring well to the left.</p>

<p>The 1st Army Corps, under Sir Douglas Haig, was in cantonments to the
north of <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>, between that place and <span lang="fr">Givry</span>. The 2nd Corps, under
Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, was to the north-west of <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>, between
that place and <span lang="fr">Sars-la-Bruyère</span>. The 19th Infantry Brigade was
concentrating at <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>.</p>

<p>Turning to our Ally, the 6th and 7th French Reserve Divisions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> were entrenching themselves on a line running from Dunkirk,
through <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> and <span lang="fr">La Capelle</span>, to <span lang="fr">Hirson</span>. The 5th French Army was on
our right, the 18th French Corps being in immediate touch with the
British Army. Three Divisions of French cavalry under General <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>,
which had been operating in support of the Belgians, were falling back
behind the 18th Corps for rest and refit. The 3rd and 4th French
Armies, comprising 8-&frac12; Corps, three Cavalry Divisions and some
reserve Divisions, were between <span lang="fr">Mézières</span> and Longwy. The French troops
further south had taken the offensive and marched into Alsace. <span lang="fr">Liége</span>
still held out. <span lang="fr">Namur</span> was intact. The Belgians seemed secure behind
the fortifications of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Before going further it would be as well to give some account of the
country in which the two opposing forces faced one another on the
night of Friday, August 21st, the area <span lang="fr">Condé&mdash;Cambrai&mdash;Le
Nouvion&mdash;Binche</span>:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Distances.</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> to <span lang="fr">Condé</span>
<span class="col70">24 miles.</span></li>

<li class="add5em"><span lang="fr">Le Nouvion</span> to <span lang="fr">Binche</span>
<span class="col70">31 miles.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This region forms part of the Belgian province of Hainault and the
French Departments of the Nord and the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, lying approximately
between the upper valleys of the Rivers Scheldt and <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>. Its
northern boundary is formed by the basin of the River Haine. This
river, formed from three streams which rise in the neighbourhood of
<span lang="fr">Binche</span>, passes <span lang="fr">Mons</span> and flows into the Scheldt at <span lang="fr">Condé</span> after a course
of 30 miles. Close to its left bank, from <span lang="fr">Mons</span> to <span lang="fr">Condé</span>, a canal
connects the former place with the Scheldt. Prior to the construction
of this canal, the Haine was navigable by means of locks. Several
small parallel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span> streams run into it from the south, along
sunken valleys in an undulating plateau, over which lie scattered the
various mines of the <span lang="fr">Bérinage</span> coalfield.</p>

<p>West of <span lang="fr">Mons</span> the valley of the Haine forms a long, low plain, covered
with meadows, through which the river meanders in broad bends as far
as the Scheldt. Numerous water ditches, cut in the peaty soil and
marked out by poplars and willows, drain the land and render the
movement off the roads of any troops but infantry quite impracticable.</p>

<p>On the northern boundary of the valley of the Haine, a belt of sand
gives rise to a tract of rough uncultivated land which is in many
places covered with woods. On its southern boundary the ground rises
steeply on the east, and more gently on the west, to the
Franco-Belgian frontier, over a rocky subsoil in which the affluents
of the river have cut deep valleys.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Mons-Condé</span> Canal has a length of 16-&frac14; miles, 12-&frac14; of which are
in Belgian territory. It has a surface width of 64 feet and its
maximum depth is 7 feet. The canal is crossed by 18 bridges, all of
which, with the exception of the railway bridge east of <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ghislain</span>
and the railway bridge at <span lang="fr">Les Herbières</span>, are swing bridges. A metalled
towing-path runs along each bank.</p>

<p>The principal passages across the valley of the <span lang="fr">Haine</span> are at <span lang="fr">Mons</span> from
Brussels, at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ghislain</span> from <span lang="fr">Ath</span>, and near <span lang="fr">Pommer&oelig;ul</span> from
<span lang="fr">Tournai</span>.</p>

<p>The Scheldt, rising near <span lang="fr">Le Catelet</span> at an altitude of 360 feet above
the sea, soon approaches the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin Canal and runs alongside it
as far as <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span>, where the river and canal flow in one channel and
form a navigable connection between the Scheldt and the <span lang="fr">Somme</span>. Below
<span lang="fr">Cambrai</span>, the now canalised river flows on to <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span>
receiving on the way on its left bank the <span lang="fr">Sensée</span> river and canal, and
on its right bank the <span lang="fr">Ereclin, Selle, Ecaillon</span>, and <span lang="fr">Rhonelle</span> streams,
which flow down in parallel courses from the watershed close to the
left bank of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>. From <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span> the Scheldt runs to <span lang="fr">Condé</span>,
where, as stated above, it is joined by the <span lang="fr">Mons-Condé</span> Canal and the
River Haine. Immediately afterwards it enters Belgian territory, where
it becomes the great river of the Flemish part of the country, just as
the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span> may be said to be the great river of the Walloon portion.</p>

<p>There are 14 locks between <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> and <span lang="fr">Condé</span>, each providing a means
of passage over the river. The general breadth of the canalised river
is 55 feet and its maximum depth 7 feet. The towing-path follows
sometimes one bank and sometimes another. The principal points of
crossing of the Scheldt between <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> and <span lang="fr">Condé</span> are at <span lang="fr">Cambrai,
Bouchain, Lourches, Denain, Bouvignies, Thiant, Trith, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Légers,
Valenciennes</span>, and <span lang="fr">Condé</span>.</p>

<p>While the Scheldt as it grows older flows through country which is for
the most part little above sea level, in its upper reaches it cuts
through an upland plateau on its way to join the Belgian central
plains.</p>

<p>Rising near <span lang="fr">Fontenelle</span>, 9 miles south-west of <span lang="fr">Avesnes</span>, the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>
flows through <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>, where it becomes navigable, and where it is
connected with the <span lang="fr">Oise</span> by the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> Canal. Flowing past <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> it
enters Belgium below <span lang="fr">Jeumont</span> and traverses thence, in a north-easterly
direction, one of the most important industrial districts of Belgium.
The country through which the river flows from its source to <span lang="fr">Charleroi</span>
forms a plateau cut up by numerous dales and deep valleys.</p>

<p>Below <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> the depth of the river is from 6 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> to 7 feet,
while its breadth is 50 feet; it is nowhere fordable. A towing-path
runs in places on the left bank, in places on the right bank. Nine
locks regulate the depth of the canal between <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> and <span lang="fr">Jeumont</span>,
and afford a means of passage for pedestrians. Communication is amply
supplied for wheeled traffic by 22 road and railway bridges, of which
the most important are those at <span lang="fr">Landrecies, Berlaimont, Hautmont,
Louvroil, Maubeuge, Jeumont, Erquelinnes, Merbes-le-Château</span> and
<span lang="fr">Lobbes</span>.</p>

<p>South of <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> important road bridges cross the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> Canal at
<span lang="fr">Catillon</span> and near <span lang="fr">Oisy</span>.</p>

<p>The principal tributaries of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>, in the area under view, flow
into the river from the eastern foothills of the <span lang="fr">Ardennes</span>; the streams
which join it on its left bank are few and insignificant. On the right
bank the <span lang="fr">Rivièrette</span>, the <span lang="fr">Helpe Mineure</span>, the <span lang="fr">Helpe Majeure</span>, the <span lang="fr">Tarsy</span>
and the <span lang="fr">Solre</span>, flowing in parallel courses in a north-westerly
direction, lie in deeply cut valleys which broaden out as they reach
the main stream. The high ground between these streams offers a
succession of defensive positions against an enemy advancing from the
north in a south-westerly direction.</p>

<p>The area under review may be divided into two portions. A northern or
industrial, with all the inconvenience to military operations
characteristic of such a district, and a southern or agricultural with
unlimited freedom of movement and view, resembling in many respects
the features of Salisbury Plain. The dividing line of these two
portions may be taken as a line running through <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span> and
<span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the thickly populated <span lang="fr">Bérinage</span> coalfield, west
and south of <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, the country is open, arable, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span> and
undulating. Extensive views are obtainable, the villages, though
numerous, are compact, and movement across country is easy.</p>

<p>A notable feature in the southern portions of the area is the <span lang="fr">Forêt de
Mormal</span> and in its neighbourhood the <span lang="fr">Bois l'Évêque</span>.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Forêt de Mormal</span>, which is 22,460 acres in extent, is situated on
the summit and slopes of the high ground bordering the left bank of
the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> between <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> and <span lang="fr">Boussières</span>. It is crossed by one
first-class road from <span lang="fr">Le Quesnoy</span> to <span lang="fr">Avesnes</span>, and several second-class
roads.</p>

<p>The forest is also traversed by two railways; that from <span lang="fr">Paris</span> to
<span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>, which follows its southern boundary from <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> to
<span lang="fr">Sassegnies</span>, and that from <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span> to <span lang="fr">Hirson</span>, which runs from
north-west to south-east and joins the former line at <span lang="fr">Aulnoye</span>. On
account of its thick undergrowth, its streams and marshy bottoms, the
forest is not passable for troops except by the above-mentioned roads.</p>

<p>Le Bois Levesque (1,805 acres), situated between <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> and <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau</span>, may be considered as an extension of the <span lang="fr">Forêt de Mormal</span>, from
which it is only about 2-&frac12; miles distant. It is traversed by the
railway line from Paris to <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>, by the road from <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> to <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau</span>, and the country road from Fontaine to Ors.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us glance at the principal places of strategic
importance in this region which witnessed the opening stages of the
retreat from <span lang="fr">Mons</span>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the war, <span class="italic" lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>, with 20,000 inhabitants,
belonged to the second class of French fortresses, which possessed a
limited armament and which were destined to act as <span class="italic" lang="fr">points d'appui</span>
for mobile forces acting in their vicinity. The strategic value of
<span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> is due to the fact that the main lines from Paris
to Brussels <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, and to northern Germany <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Charleroi</span> and
<span lang="fr">Liége</span>, pass through the town, while from it runs a line towards the
eastern frontier <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Hirson</span> and <span lang="fr">Mézières</span>, with branch lines leading
to <span lang="fr">Laon</span> and <span lang="fr">Châlons</span>. It is also a junction of main roads from
<span lang="fr">Valenciennes, Mons, Charleroi</span>, and <span lang="fr">Laon</span>.</p>

<p>The fortress has a circumference of about 20 miles. The forts, which
lie in open country, are mostly small. Shortly before the outbreak of
the War the defences of <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> had been strengthened to meet the
increased effect of high explosives, and various redoubts and
batteries had been constructed in addition to the above-mentioned
works.</p>

<p><span class="italic" lang="fr">Mons</span>, the capital of Hainault, had a pre-war population of 28,000
inhabitants, and is situated on a sandhill overlooking the <span lang="fr">Trovillon</span>.
It is the centre of the <span lang="fr">Bérinage</span>, the chief coal-mining district of
Belgium. Main roads from Brussels, <span lang="fr">Binche, Charleroi, Valenciennes</span> and
<span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> have their meeting place here, while the railway from Paris
to Brussels passes through it. It is also the junction point of the
canal from <span lang="fr">Condé</span> and the <span lang="fr">Canal Du Centre</span>, which connects the former
with the <span lang="fr">Charleroi</span> Canal and the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>.</p>

<p>The town of <span class="italic" lang="fr">Binche</span> (12,000 inhabitants), lying 15 miles
east-south-east of <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, is a centre of roads from <span lang="fr">Charleroi,
Brussels, Mons, Bavai</span>, and <span lang="fr">Beaumont</span>. Through it passes a double line
of railway coming from <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> on its way to Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="italic" lang="fr">Condé</span>, a small and old fortified town, owes its military value to
its position at the confluence of the Scheldt and the Haine, and to
its canal communications with <span lang="fr">Mons</span>. A single railway line connects it
on the north with <span lang="fr">Tournai</span> and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> on the south with
<span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>. The main road from <span lang="fr">Audenarde</span> to <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span> and <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span>
passes here.</p>

<p>The strategetical importance of <span class="italic" lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>, a town of 32,000
inhabitants, is due to its being the meeting places of main roads from
<span lang="fr">Cambrai, Lille, Tournai, Condé</span> and <span lang="fr">Mons</span>. It is also the junction point
of the main lines from Paris <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Cambrai, Hirson</span>, and the north. Its
position on the canalised Scheldt has been already referred to.</p>

<p><span class="italic" lang="fr">Cambrai</span> (28,000 inhabitants), lying on the right bank of the
Scheldt, which first becomes navigable here, is the centre of main
roads from <span lang="fr">Péronne, Bapaume, Arras, Douai, Valenciennes, Bavai</span> and <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau</span>. It is also important as being the junction point of railways
from Paris to <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span> and from <span lang="fr">Douai</span> to <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin</span>.</p>

<p><span class="italic" lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>, where, as I have already said, I established my first
General Headquarters in France, is situated on the Selle. Before the
War its population numbered 10,700 and it possessed important woollen
mills. It is the junction point of main roads connecting <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>
with <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin</span> and <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> with <span lang="fr">Le Nouvion</span>. It also stands on the
main line from Paris to <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>, while single-line railways connect
it with <span lang="fr">Cambrai, Valenciennes</span>, and <span lang="fr">Le Quesnoy</span>.</p>

<p>Lastly, with regard to communications throughout the area, they were
good and ample. The principal roads from north to south are those from
<span lang="fr">Condé</span>, through <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>, to <span lang="fr">Cambrai, Le Cateau</span>, and <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>,
and from <span lang="fr">Mons</span> to <span lang="fr">Binche</span>, to <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Bavai</span> and to <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>
through <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>. Numerous second-class roads afford good lateral
communications between the above-mentioned roads.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the region in which, on the night of Friday, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span>
August 21st, the British Expeditionary Force found itself awaiting its
first great trial of strength with the enemy. That night we went to
sleep in high hopes. The mobilisation, transport, and concentration of
the British Army had been effected without a hitch. The troops had not
only been able to rest after their journey, but a few days had been
available for practice marches and for overhauling equipment. The
condition of the reservists, even those who had been longest away from
the colours, was excellent and constantly improving.</p>

<p>The highest spirit pervaded all ranks, and the army with one accord
longed to be at grips with the enemy. The cavalry had been pushed well
to the front, and such engagements as had taken place between
detachments of larger or smaller patrols had foreshadowed that moral
superiority of British over German which was afterwards so completely
established, and proved of such enormous value in the retreat, the
Battles of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> and the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, and in the opening phases of the
first Battle of Ypres. The French troops had already secured minor
successes, and had penetrated into the enemy's territory. The Allied
Commanders were full of hope and confidence.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span></h3>

<h4>THE RETREAT FROM MONS</h4>


<p>At 5 a.m. on the 22nd I awoke, as I had lain down to sleep, in high
hopes. No evil foreboding of coming events had visited me in dreams;
but it was not many hours later that the disillusionment began. I
started by motor in the very early hours of a beautiful August morning
to visit General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> at his Headquarters in the neighbourhood of
<span lang="fr">Philippeville</span>.</p>

<p>Soon after entering the area of the 5th French Army, I found my motor
stopped at successive cross roads by columns of infantry and artillery
moving <span class="italic">south</span>. After several such delays on my journey, and before I
had gone half the distance, I suddenly came up with Captain Spiers of
the 11th Hussars, who was the liaison officer at General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>'s
Headquarters.</p>

<p>There is an atmosphere engendered by troops retiring, when they expect
to be advancing, which is unmistakable to anyone who has had much
experience of war. It matters not whether such a movement is the
result of a lost battle, an unsuccessful engagement, or is in the
nature of a "strategic man&oelig;uvre to the rear." The fact that,
whatever the reason may be, it means giving up ground to the enemy,
affects the spirits of the troops and manifests itself in the
discontented, apprehensive expression which is seen on the faces of
the men, and the tired, slovenly, unwilling gait which invariably
characterises troops subjected to this ordeal.</p>

<p>This <span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> atmosphere surrounded me for some time before I met
Spiers and before he had spoken a word. My optimistic visions of the
night before had vanished, and what he told me did not tend to bring
them back. He reported that the Guard and 7th German Corps had since
daybreak advanced on the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> in the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Franière</span>, and
had attacked the 10th French Corps which was holding the river. The
advanced troops had driven the Germans back; but he added that
"offensive action was contrary to General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>'s plans," and that
this had "annoyed him."</p>

<p>The 10th Corps had had to fall back with some loss, and were taking up
ground known as the "<span lang="fr">Fosse Position</span>," on the south side of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>.
Spiers thought that the 10th Corps had been knocked about a good deal.
He gave me various items of information gleaned from the Chief of
Intelligence of the French 5th Army. These reports went to show that
the German turning movement in Belgium was extending far towards the
west, the right being kept well forward as though a powerful
envelopment was designed. It was evident that the enemy was making
some progress in his attempts to bridge and cross the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> all along
the front of the 5th Army. There appeared to be some difficulty in
finding General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>, and therefore I decided to return at once to
my Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>.</p>

<p>I found there that our own Intelligence had received information which
confirmed a good deal of what I had heard in the morning. They thought
that at least three German Corps were advancing upon us, the most
westerly having reached as far as <span lang="fr">Ath</span>.</p>

<p>The hopes and anticipations with which I concluded the last chapter
underwent considerable modification from these experiences <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span>
and events; but the climax of the day's disappointment and
disillusionment was not reached till 11 p.m., when the Head of the
French Military Mission at my Headquarters, Colonel <span lang="fr">Huguet</span>, brought a
French Staff Officer to me who had come direct from General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>.
This officer reported the fighting of which Spiers had already
informed me, and said that the French 10th Corps had suffered very
heavily. When thinking of our estimates of losses in those days, it
must be remembered that a dearly bought experience had not yet opened
our minds to the terrible toll which modern war exacts.</p>

<p>The position of the 5th French Army extended from <span lang="fr">Dinant</span> on the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>
(just north of <span lang="fr">Fosse&mdash;Charleroi&mdash;Thuin</span> back to <span lang="fr">Trélon</span>) about five
Corps in all. <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>'s Cavalry Corps had reported that probably three
German Corps were advancing on Brussels.</p>

<p>The German line facing the Anglo-French Army was thought to be
"roughly" <span lang="fr">Soignies&mdash;Nivelles&mdash;Gembloux</span>, and thence circling to the
north of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>, round <span lang="fr">Namur</span>. A strong column of German infantry
was advancing on <span lang="fr">Charleroi</span> from <span lang="fr">Fleurus</span> about 3 p.m. on the 21st.
There had been heavy fighting at <span lang="fr">Tamines</span>, on the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>, in which
French troops had been worsted. General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> was anxious to know
if I would attack the flank of the German columns which were pressing
him back from the river.</p>

<p>In view of the most probable situation of the German Army, as it was
known to both of us, and the palpable intention of its Commander to
effect a great turning movement round my left flank, and having regard
to the actual numbers of which I was able to dispose, it is very
difficult to realise what was in <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>'s mind when he made such a
request to me.</p>

<p>As <span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> the left of the French 5th Army (Reserve Division of 18th
Corps) was drawn back as far as <span lang="fr">Trélon</span>, and the centre and right of
that Army were in process of retiring, the forward position I now held
on the <span lang="fr">Condé</span> Canal might quickly become very precarious.</p>

<p>I, therefore, informed <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> in reply that such an operation as he
suggested was quite impracticable for me. I agreed to retain my
present position for 24 hours; but after that time I told him it would
be necessary for me to consider whether the weight against my front
and outer flank, combined with the retreat of the French 5th Army,
would not compel me to go back to the <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> position.</p>

<p>I should mention that earlier in the day, on my return to Headquarters
after my talk with Spiers, I had despatched the following message to
General <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am waiting for the dispositions arranged for to be carried out,
especially the posting of French Cavalry Corps on my left. I am
prepared to fulfil the <span class="italic">rôle</span> allotted to me when the 5th Army
advances to the attack.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, I hold an advanced defensive position extending from
<span lang="fr">Condé</span> on the left, through <span lang="fr">Mons</span> to <span lang="fr">Erquelinnes</span>, where I connect with
two Reserve Divisions south of the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span>. I am now much in advance of
the line held by the 5th Army and feel my position to be as forward as
circumstances will allow, particularly in view of the fact that I am
not properly prepared for offensive action till to-morrow morning, as
I have previously informed you.</p>

<p>"I do not understand from your wire that the 18th Corps has yet been
engaged, and they stand on my inner flank."</p>

<p>I left my Headquarters at 5 a.m. on Sunday the 23rd and went to
<span lang="fr">Sars-la-Bruyère</span> (Headquarters of the 2nd Corps), <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> and there I
met Haig, Smith-Dorrien, and Allenby.</p>

<p>The cavalry had, during the 22nd, drawn off towards my left flank
after heavy pressure by the enemy's advancing columns, leaving
detachments in front of my right to the east of <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, which was not so
severely threatened. These detachments extended in a south-easterly
direction south of Bray and <span lang="fr">Binche</span>, the latter place having been
occupied by the enemy. They were in touch with the 5th French Army.
Patrols and advanced squadrons had engaged similar bodies of the enemy
and had held their own well.</p>

<p>The 2nd Corps occupied the line of the <span lang="fr">Condé</span> Canal, from that place
round the salient which the canal makes to the north of <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, and
extended thence to the east of <span lang="fr">Obourg</span>, whence that part of the line
was drawn back towards <span lang="fr">Villers-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ghislain</span>.</p>

<p>The 5th Division was holding the line from <span lang="fr">Condé</span> to Mariette, whilst
the 3rd Division continued the line thence round the salient to the
right of the line occupied by the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>The 1st Corps was echeloned on the right and in rear of the 2nd.</p>

<p>I told the commanders of the doubts which had arisen in my mind during
the previous 24 hours, and impressed on them the necessity of being
prepared for any kind of move, either in advance or in retreat. I
discussed exhaustively the situation on our front.</p>

<p>Allenby's bold and searching reconnaissance had not led me to believe
that we were threatened by forces against which we could not make an
effective stand. The 2nd Corps had not yet been seriously engaged,
while the 1st was practically still in reserve.</p>

<p>Allenby's orders to concentrate towards the left flank when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span>
pressed by the advance of the enemy's main columns had been
practically carried into effect. I entertained some anxiety as to the
salient which the canal makes north of <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, and enjoined on
Smith-Dorrien particular watchfulness and care with regard to it.</p>

<p>They all assured me that a quiet night had been passed and that their
line was firmly taken up and held.</p>

<p>The air reconnaissance had started at daybreak, and I decided to await
aircraft reports from Henderson before making any decided plan.</p>

<p>I instructed Sir Archibald Murray, my Chief of Staff, to remain for
the present at General Smith-Dorrien's Headquarters at
<span lang="fr">Sars-la-Bruyère</span>, and gave him full instructions as to arrangements
which must be made if a retreat became necessary. I then went on to
<span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>. General Drummond (Commanding the 19th Infantry Brigade)
and the French Commandant at <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span> met me at the station.</p>

<p>I inspected a part of the entrenchments which were under construction,
and the disposition of the Territorial troops (two divisions under
General <span lang="fr">d'Amade</span>) which were detailed to hold them and to guard our
left flank. The 19th Brigade (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Welsh Fusiliers, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Scottish Rifles, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Middlesex <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Argyle and
Sutherland Highlanders) was just completing its detrainment, and I
placed Drummond under the orders of General Allenby commanding the
Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>During this day (August 23rd) reports continued to reach me of heavy
pressure on our outposts all along the line, but chiefly between <span lang="fr">Condé</span>
and <span lang="fr">Mons</span>.</p>

<p>Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, it will be remembered, was now in command of
the 2nd Corps, having been sent out from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> England in
succession to Sir James Grierson on the latter's untimely death.</p>

<p>After my conference with the Corps Commanders on the morning of the
23rd, I left General Smith-Dorrien full of confidence in regard to his
position, but when I returned to my Headquarters in the afternoon,
reports came to hand that he was giving up the salient at <span lang="fr">Mons</span> because
the outpost line at <span lang="fr">Obourg</span> had been penetrated by the enemy, and that
he was also preparing to give up the whole of the line of the canal
before nightfall. He said that he anticipated a gap occurring in his
line between the 3rd and 5th Divisions in the neighbourhood of
Mariette, and he went so far as to make a request for help to the 1st
Corps.</p>

<p>Up to this time there was no decided threat in any strength on <span lang="fr">Condé</span>,
Sir Horace, therefore, need not have feared an imminent turning
movement, and, as regards his front, he was nowhere threatened by
anything more than cavalry supported by small bodies of infantry.</p>

<p>At that time no directions for retreat had been issued from
Headquarters, although the Chief of the General Staff had been left at
<span lang="fr">Sars-la-Bruyère</span> on purpose to give orders for such a movement if it
should become necessary.</p>

<p>The General's anxiety seems to have lessened later in the afternoon,
for at 5 p.m. a message from the 2nd Corps said that the commander was
"well satisfied with the situation."</p>

<p>The 3rd Division was now effecting a retirement south of the canal to
a line running west through Nouvelles, and this movement had the
inevitable result of bringing back the 5th Division and handing over
the bridges of the canal to the German cavalry.</p>

<p>Every report I was now receiving at Headquarters pointed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> to
the early necessity of a retirement of the British Forces in view of
the general strategic situation, and I did not, therefore, deem it
desirable to interfere with the 2nd Corps commander.</p>

<p>Reports of German activity on his front continued to be received from
the <abbr title="general officer commanding-in-charge">G.O.C.</abbr> 2nd Corps. At 7.15 p.m. he asked for permission to retire
on <span lang="fr">Bavai</span>; at 9.45 he was again reassured&mdash;a Divisional Headquarters
which had retired was now "moving forward again"; and at 10.20 p.m. he
reported, "casualties in no way excessive; all quiet now."</p>

<p>The line which the 2nd Corps had taken up for the night showed an
average retirement of three miles south of the canal. During the late
afternoon the advanced troops of the 1st Corps were engaged, but not
seriously threatened; they held their ground.</p>

<p>During the late afternoon and evening very disquieting reports had
arrived as to the situation on my right. These were confirmed later in
a telegram from French Headquarters, which arrived at half-past eleven
at night. It clearly showed that our present position was
strategically untenable; but this conclusion had been forced upon me
much earlier in the evening when I received a full appreciation of the
situation as it then appeared at French General Headquarters. General
<span lang="fr">Joffre</span> also told me that his information led him to expect that I
might be attacked the next day by at least three German Corps and two
Cavalry Divisions.</p>

<p>Appreciating the situation from the point of view which all reports
now clearly established, my last hope of an offensive had to be
abandoned, and it became necessary to consider an immediate retreat
from our present forward position.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span> selected the new line from <span lang="fr">Jerlain</span> (south-east of
<span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>) eastwards to <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>. This line had already been
reconnoitred. The Corps and Divisional Staff Officers who were called
into Headquarters to receive orders, especially those of the 2nd
Corps, thought our position was much more seriously threatened than it
really was and, in fact, one or two expressed doubts as to the
possibility of effecting a retirement in the presence of the enemy in
our immediate front. I did not share these views, and Colonel Vaughan
(Chief of the Staff of the Cavalry Division) was more inclined to
accept my estimate of the enemy's forces on or near the canal than the
others were. His opportunities of gauging the enemy's strength and
dispositions had been greatly enhanced by the fine reconnoitring work
done on the previous two or three days by the Cavalry Division.
However, I determined to effect the retreat, and orders were issued
accordingly.</p>

<p>The 1st Army Corps was to move up towards <span lang="fr">Givry</span> and to take up a good
line to cover the retreat of the 2nd Corps towards <span lang="fr">Bavai</span>, which was to
commence at daybreak. Our front and left flank was to be screened and
covered by the cavalry and the 19th Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>At about 1 a.m. on the 24th, Spiers came in from the Headquarters of
the 5th French Army and told me that they were seriously checked all
along the line. The 3rd and 4th French Armies were retiring, and the
5th French Army, after its check on Saturday, was conforming to the
general movement.</p>

<p>The information previously referred to as arriving from French
Headquarters at 11.30 p.m. on the 23rd was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="decimal">
<li><span lang="fr">Namur</span> fell this day.</li>
<li>The 5th French Army had been attacked all along
  their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> front by the 3rd German Corps, the Guard, the 10th
  and 7th Corps, and was falling back on the line <span lang="fr">Givet&mdash;Philippeville&mdash;Maubeuge</span>.</li>
<li><span lang="fr">Hastière</span> had been captured by the Germans on
  the 23rd.</li>
<li>The <span lang="fr">Meuse</span> was falling rapidly and becoming fordable
  in many places, hence the difficulty of defence.</li>
</ul>

<p>At 5.30 a.m. on the 24th I went out to my advanced Headquarters, which
had been established at <span lang="fr">Bavai</span>, a small village which is strategically
important from the circumstance that it is the meeting place of roads
from every point of the compass. The orders issued through the night
had been carried out. The 1st Corps was on the line
<span lang="fr">Nouvelles&mdash;Harmignies&mdash;Givry</span>, with Corps Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Bonnet</span>. They
were making an excellent stand to cover the retirement of the 2nd
Corps, which was being hard pressed, particularly the 5th Division to
the south-east of <span lang="fr">Condé</span>. In fact, at 10 a.m. General Fergusson,
Commanding the Division, found it necessary to call very urgently upon
General Allenby for help and support. The 19th Infantry Brigade under
Drummond had, it will be remembered, been placed at the disposal of
the commander of the Cavalry Division, who, calling this Brigade up in
immediate support of the 5th Division, directed Gough's 3rd and De
Lisle's 2nd Cavalry Brigades (3rd Cavalry Brigade: 4th Hussars, 5th
Lancers, and 16th Lancers; 2nd Cavalry Brigade: 4th Dragoon Guards,
9th Lancers, and 18th Hussars) to threaten and harass the flanks of
the advancing German troops, whilst Bingham's 4th Cavalry Brigade
remained in observation towards the west.</p>

<p>The intervention of Allenby and Drummond, and the support they
rendered, was most effective in taking the severe <span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span> pressure
of the enemy off the 5th Division and enabling it to continue its
retreat. About 11.30 a.m. the 2nd Corps Headquarters were retired from
<span lang="fr">Sars-la-Bruyère</span> to <span lang="fr">Hon</span>.</p>

<p>Soon after arriving at <span lang="fr">Bavai</span> I visited the Headquarters of the 1st
Corps at Bonnet and observed the fighting above mentioned. Our troops
in this part of the line were very active and pushing. The 8th Brigade
under Davies (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Scots, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Irish <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 4th
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Middlesex Regt. and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Gordon Highlanders) was now at
Nouvelles, on the left; then came the rest of the 2nd Division, and
then the 1st Division under Lomax, on the right.</p>

<p>I went out from Haig's Headquarters to a high ridge, whence the ground
slopes down towards the north and north-east, along a gentle declivity
stretching almost to the canal which was some distance away. The
situation of the 1st Corps was excellent, and the artillery positions
were well chosen. From where we stood we could observe the effect of
our fire. It was very accurate, and shrapnel could be seen bursting
well over the enemy lines and holding his advance in complete check,
whilst the German fire was by no means so effective. The infantry were
defending their position a long way down the slope with great
determination and tenacity. The steadfast attitude and skilful retreat
of our right wing at <span lang="fr">Mons</span> had much to do with the success of our
withdrawal, and the short time I spent with the 1st Corps that morning
inspired me with great confidence.</p>

<p>The subsequent retirement of the 1st Corps was carried out
successfully and with little loss, Haig's Headquarters being
established at <span lang="fr">Riez de l'Erelle</span> at about 1 p.m.</p>

<p>After visiting some important points in the field over which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span>
the 2nd Corps was fighting, I determined to seek out General <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>,
Commanding the French Cavalry Corps, which was in cantonments
somewhere to the east of <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>. I found <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>'s Headquarters at
<span lang="fr">Avesnes</span>. The scene in the village was very typical of continental war
as it has been so often presented to us in pictures of the war of
1870.</p>

<p>The Commander of the French Cavalry Corps and his Staff, whom I met in
the central square, formed a striking group against a very suitable
background of gun parks and ammunition wagons. One looked in vain for
the fire-eating <span class="italic" lang="fr">beau sabreur</span> of a Murat.</p>

<p>The man who had come back from that first desperate onslaught in
Belgium, and had so grandly supported and succoured our hard-pressed
Allies in their splendid defence, was a very quiet, undemonstrative,
spare little figure of at least 60 years of age. He appeared hard and
fit, and showed no sign of the tremendous strain he had already
undergone. On the contrary, he was smart and dapper, and looked like
the light-weight horseman he is. His clear-cut face and small, regular
features, denoted descent from the old <span class="italic">noblesse</span>, and he struck me in
his bright tunic as one who might be most fittingly imaged in a piece
of old Dresden china; but added to all this was the bearing of a
Cavalry Commander.</p>

<p>His manner was courteous in the extreme; but he showed inflexible
firmness and determination.</p>

<p>His Staff were of the pattern of French cavalry officers. I have seen
much of them for years past at man&oelig;uvres, etc., and they combine
the best qualities of cavalry leaders with the utmost <span class="italic" lang="fr">camaraderie</span>
and good fellowship.</p>

<p>I interviewed the General at some length, pointing out <span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span> what
I had been told by General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and his Chief of Staff, namely, that
the Cavalry Corps had been directed to operate on my left or outer
flank. I informed him that in my opinion this was the point where his
presence was chiefly required, and where his action would be most
effective in checking the advance of the enemy. I told the General
that I should be very glad of his help in that locality as soon as
possible, because in my present forward position, and having regard to
the continued retirement of the 5th French Army, I should sorely need
all the assistance I could get to establish the Army under my command
in their new position.</p>

<p>General <span lang="fr">Sordet</span> was very courteous and sympathetic. He expressed the
utmost desire to help me in every possible way. He added that he had
received no orders to move to the left flank and must, therefore,
await these instructions before he could march. He further told me
that after the arduous time he had experienced when supporting the
Belgian Army, his horses stood in the most urgent need of rest, and
that, in any case, it would be impossible for him to leave his present
position for at least 24 hours. He promised, however, to do all in his
power to help me, and, as my story will presently show, he kept his
word splendidly.</p>

<p>I then went back to <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> to pick up any messages or news from
<span lang="fr">Joffre</span> or <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>. Here I was gladdened by the sight of the
detrainment of the advanced troops of the 4th Division (General Snow).</p>

<p>After a brief halt at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>, I started again for my advanced
Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Bavai</span>. The experiences of that afternoon remain
indelibly impressed on my memory. Very shortly after leaving <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>
I was met by streams of Belgian refugees, flying from <span lang="fr">Mons</span> and its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> neighbourhood. They were lying about the fields in all
directions, and blocking the roads with carts and vans in which they
were trying to carry off as much of their worldly goods as possible.
The whole country-side showed those concrete evidences of disturbance
and alarm which brought home to all our minds what this retreat meant
and all that it might come to mean.</p>

<p>After much delay from these causes I reached <span lang="fr">Bavai</span> about 2.30 p.m.,
and it was with great difficulty that my motor could wind its way
through the mass of carts, horses, fugitives and military baggage
trains which literally covered almost every yard of space in the small
town. The temporary advanced Headquarters were established in the
market place, the appearance of which defies description. The babel of
voices, the crying of women and children, mingled with the roar of the
guns and the not far distant crack of rifles and machine guns, made a
deafening noise, amidst which it was most difficult to keep a clear
eye and tight grip on the rapidly changing course of events.</p>

<p>In a close room on the upper floor of the Mairie I found Murray, my
Chief of Staff, working hard, minus belt, coat and collar. The heat
was intense. The room was filled with Staff Officers bringing reports
or awaiting instructions. Some of the Headquarters Staff had not
closed their eyes for 48 hours, and were stretched out on forms or
huddled up in corners, wrapped in that deep slumber which only comes
to brains which, for the time being, are completely worn out.</p>

<p>If some of the armchair critics who so glibly talk of the easy time
which Staff Officers, compared with their regimental comrades, have in
war&mdash;if some of them could have watched that scene, they would be more
chary of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span> forming such opinions and spreading such wrong
ideas.</p>

<p>Personally, I have always been far more a regimental than a Staff
Officer, and I have every reason to sympathise with the former, but
when I have witnessed scenes and gone through days such as I am now
very imperfectly describing, and when I know such days to be frequent
and long drawn out occurrences in war, it makes my blood boil to hear
and to read of the calumnies which are often heaped upon the head of
the unfortunate "Staff."</p>

<p>Murray did splendid work that day and set the best of examples. On my
arrival at <span lang="fr">Bavai</span> he reported the situation fully and clearly to me.
The action of the cavalry and the 19th Brigade on the left had greatly
relieved the heavy pressure on the 5th Division, and the retirement
was proceeding fairly well.</p>

<p>Information had, however, reached me of the defeat and retreat of the
3rd French Army, and the continued falling back of <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>. I judged
also, by the method and direction of the attack, that strenuous
attempts were being made to turn our left flank and press me back on
<span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span>. The force opposed to me was growing in size, and I judged it
to be more than double my numbers. As subsequent information proved,
we were actually opposed by four corps and at least two cavalry
divisions.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon it was clear to me that further definite
decisions must be taken. We could not stand on the line towards which
the troops were now retiring.</p>

<p>The fortress of <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> lay close on my right rear. It was well
fortified and provisioned. It is impossible for anyone, who has not
been situated as I was, to realise the terrible temptation which such
a place offers to an army seeking shelter against overpowering odds.</p>

<p>For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span> a short time on this fateful afternoon I debated within
myself whether or not I should yield to this temptation; but I did not
hesitate long, because there were two considerations which forced
themselves prominently upon my mind.</p>

<p>In the first place, I had an instinctive feeling that this was exactly
what the enemy was trying to make me do; and, in the second place, I
had the example of <span lang="fr">Bazaine</span> and <span lang="fr">Metz</span> in 1870 present in my mind, and
the words of Sir Edward Hamley's able comment upon the decision of the
French Marshal came upon me with overwhelming force. Hamley described
it as "The anxiety of the temporising mind which prefers postponement
of a crisis to vigorous enterprise." Of <span lang="fr">Bazaine</span> he says, "In clinging
to <span lang="fr">Metz</span> he acted like one who, when the ship is foundering, should lay
hold of the anchor."</p>

<p>I therefore abandoned all such ideas, and issued orders at about 3
p.m. directing the retreat some miles further back to the line <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau&mdash;Cambrai</span>.</p>

<p>The pressure of the enemy on our left flank became greater towards
night. All reports and reconnaissances indicated a determined attempt
to outflank us and cut across our line of retreat, but Allenby's
cavalry was splendidly disposed and handled. The German columns were
kept at bay, and the troops bivouacked generally on a line somewhat
south of that towards which they had been ordered to retreat in the
morning. There was some confusion in the retirement of the 2nd Corps.
The 5th Division crossed the rear of the 3rd near <span lang="fr">Bavai</span>, got to the
east of them and somewhat on the line of the retreat of the 1st Corps,
whose movement was thus hampered and delayed.</p>

<p>I got back to Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> late in the evening, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span>
where a budget of reports awaited me. The most important news was
contained in a telephone message received at 9.40 p.m. from Major
Clive of the Grenadier Guards, who was my liaison officer at French
Headquarters. This ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The 4th Army, fighting against an enemy estimated at three Corps, has
fallen back to the line <span lang="fr">Virton&mdash;Spincourt</span>. Three Reserve Divisions
made a counter-attack this afternoon from the south against the
enemy's left flank. The 3rd Army, fighting in difficult country, has
fallen back to better ground this side of the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>, about <span lang="fr">Mézières</span>
and <span lang="fr">Stenai</span>. The enemy have been unable to cross the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span>. The 3rd
Army is waiting for sufficient strength to make a counter-attack from
its right. The 1st Corps of the 5th Army found that the Germans had
crossed the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span> behind them south of <span lang="fr">Dinant</span>; they therefore fell
back to the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Givet</span> and <span lang="fr">Philippeville</span>."</p>

<p>Murray followed me to Headquarters about 3 a.m., and reported that all
orders had been carried out effectually and that the move was
proceeding satisfactorily. All the troops were very tired and had
suffered severely from the heat. Our losses in the fighting of the
last two days were considerable, but not excessive, having regard to
the nature of the operations.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the 25th the retreat was continued, again
covered skilfully by Allenby's cavalry.</p>

<p>During the night the 4th Division had nearly completed their
detrainment, and were taking up the position assigned to them towards
<span lang="fr">Cambrai</span>. In the course of the morning of the 25th I visited Snow, who
commanded this Division, and went over the ground with him.</p>

<p>The only action of importance during the day occurred at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span>
<span lang="fr">Solesmes</span>, when the rearguard of the 3rd Division under McCracken was
heavily attacked. Allenby, with the 2nd Cavalry Brigade (4th Dragoon
Guards, 9th Lancers, and 18th Hussars), came to his assistance and
enabled him to continue his retreat. He did not, however, arrive at
his appointed destination till late in the evening, and then it was
with very tired men.</p>

<p>The reports received up till noon of the 25th showed that the French
were retiring all along the line, and there was no longer any doubt in
my mind as to the strength and intention of the enemy in our own
immediate front. Three Corps and a Cavalry Division were concentrating
against us, whilst a fourth Corps and another Cavalry Division were
trying to turn our western flank.</p>

<p>I had now to consider the position most carefully and again come to a
momentous decision. Was I to stand and fight on the line to which the
Army was now retiring (<span lang="fr">Le Cateau&mdash;Cambrai</span>) or continue the retreat at
daybreak?</p>

<p>To hold the <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> position in view of the heavy threat on my front
and western flank was a decision which could only be justified if I
were sure of the absolute determination of the French Commander to
hold on all along the line with the utmost tenacity; but our Allies
were already a day's march in rear of us, and every report indicated
continual retreat. At least one Army Corps and two Cavalry Divisions
of the enemy were engaged in an outflanking movement on my left, in
which they had already made some progress, and the only help I could
depend upon in that quarter was from two French Reserve Divisions
spread out on an enormous front towards Dunkirk, and very hastily and
indifferently entrenched. It was unlikely that they would be able to
oppose any effective resistance to the enemy's flank movement.</p>

<p>If <span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span> this flank attack were successful, my communications with
<span lang="fr">Havre</span> would be practically gone.</p>

<p>There had been neither time nor labour available to make the <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>
position strong enough to withstand a serious onslaught by the
superior numbers which were advancing against my front, and the
British troops, which had been almost continuously marching and
fighting since Sunday morning, stood in much need of rest, which could
only be secured by placing some serious obstacle, such as a river
line, between my troops and the enemy.</p>

<p>After long and anxious deliberation, it seemed clear to me that every
consideration pointed to the necessity of resuming our march in
retreat at daybreak on the 26th, and orders to that effect were
accordingly issued.</p>

<p>I determined to direct the march on <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin</span> and <span lang="fr">Noyon</span>. The troops
were to be held so concentrated as to enable me to take immediate
advantage of any change in the situation which might check the retreat
and offer favourable opportunities for taking the offensive. Failing
such developments, my idea was to concentrate behind the Somme or the
Oise. Behind such a barrier I should be able to rest the troops, fill
up casualties and deficiencies in material, and remain ready to act
effectively with the Allies in whatever direction circumstances might
dictate.</p>

<p>The retreat had been resumed at daybreak, and at 6 p.m. all the troops
of the 2nd Corps were on the <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> line except McCracken's
Brigade, which, as before described, had been obliged to stand and
fight at <span lang="fr">Solesmes</span>. The 1st Corps, however, was delayed in starting for
several hours, and was only able to reach the neighbourhood of
<span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>; so that at the conclusion of the day's march a somewhat
dangerous gap existed between the 1st and 2nd <span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span> Corps, which
caused me considerable anxiety in the small hours of the morning of
the 26th.</p>

<p>When darkness fell on the 25th, the enemy had sent forward advance
troops in motors and lorries through the <span lang="fr">Forêt de Mormal</span> in pursuit of
the 1st Corps. This culminated in a violent attack on <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>,
which, however, was splendidly driven off with heavy loss to the
enemy, chiefly by the 4th (Guards) Brigade under Brigadier-General
Scott-Kerr.</p>

<p>With reference to this action, the following is an extract from a
letter which I despatched to Lord Kitchener on August 27th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The 4th Brigade were fighting in the early morning in the streets of
<span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>. A German infantry column, about the strength of a brigade,
emerged from the wood north of the town and advanced south in the
closest order, filling up the narrow street.</p>

<p>"Two or three of our machine guns were brought to bear on this
magnificent target from the other end of the town. The head of the
column was checked and stopped, a frightful panic ensued, and it is
estimated that, in a very few minutes, no less than 800 to 900 dead
and wounded Germans were lying in the streets."</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig, although his troops were very tired and handicapped
also by heavy rearguard fighting, still proceeded to carry out the
instructions he had received, and the retirement of the 1st Corps was
continued in excellent order and with complete efficiency.</p>

<p>Things did not go so well with the 2nd Corps. General Allenby, who had
been most ably covering the retreat of the Army with his cavalry, had
already materially assisted the rearguard of the 3rd Division to
surmount their difficulties at <span lang="fr">Solesmes</span>. McCracken's Brigade (7th)
(3rd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Worcester <span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span> <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Lancs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Wilts <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Irish Rifles) did not reach the <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau</span> position until 10 or 11 p.m. on the 25th. His men were, of
course, nearly done up, and he had suffered severe losses.</p>

<p>Colonel Ansell, Commanding the 5th Dragoon Guards, one of the finest
cavalry leaders in the Army, who fell at the head of his regiment a
few days later, gave information to General Allenby at about 2 a.m.
regarding the nature of the German advance. This seemed of such great
importance that the latter at once sought out Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien
and warned him that, unless he was prepared to continue his march at
daybreak, he would most probably be pinned down to his position and
would be unable to get away. Sir Horace asked General Allenby what, in
his opinion, were the chances he had if he remained and held the
position, adding that he felt convinced his troops were so exhausted
as to preclude the possibility of removing them for some hours to
come. Allenby's reply was that he thought, unless the commander of the
2nd Corps made up his mind to move at daybreak, the enemy probably
would succeed in surrounding him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Sir Horace determined to fight. As to this decision, a
commander on the spot, and in close touch with his Divisions and
Brigades, is in the best position to judge of what his men can do.</p>

<p>I had, late on the evening of the 25th, before leaving for my
Headquarters at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin, visited several units of the 2nd Corps in
their bivouacs and, though tired indeed, they had not struck me as
being worn out troops.</p>

<p>By the break of day on the 26th the 5th Division on the right had
secured several hours' rest. The same may be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> said of the 8th
and 9th Brigades, which came next in the line. The 7th Brigade had
only just arrived at cantonments at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. on the 25th,
after a heavy day's march and some severe fighting, but they could in
such an emergency have marched at dawn. The 4th Division on the left
of the 2nd Corps was comparatively fresh.</p>

<p>I visited in particular one Artillery Brigade, some of whose guns had
been saved from capture on the previous day by the cavalry. The
Brigade Commander broke down with emotion as he recounted to me the
glorious bravery displayed by Francis Grenfell and the 9th Lancers.</p>

<p>This Brigade fought magnificently for several hours next day on the <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau</span> position.</p>

<p>All reconnaissance and intelligence reports received up to midnight on
the 25th concur in saying that <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> was then still in the
possession of the French, and that the position there was not yet
seriously threatened; further, that whilst there were clear signs of
the outflanking movement in progress, no considerable bodies of the
enemy had yet crossed the line <span lang="fr">Valenciennes&mdash;Douai</span>, and that, after
their repulse at <span lang="fr">Solesmes</span> by McCracken and Allenby, the enemy was not
in strength south of the line <span lang="fr">Valenciennes&mdash;Maubeuge</span>.</p>

<p>This estimate of the situation was confirmed by a German wireless
message, intercepted towards the evening of the 26th, which stated
that the outflanking German Corps was only at that time "moving
towards" <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span>, and that the remaining Corps, which were engaged in
the frontal attack, were only then "moving on" towards <span lang="fr">Cattenières</span>,
Walincourt and <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> respectively.</p>

<p>The 1st Corps had, as we know, experienced a much harder day's march
on the 25th, and was attacked at <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> and its
neighbourhood before it could get any rest at all. Sir Douglas
correctly appreciated the strength of the enemy on his immediate front
and gauged the situation, namely, the German design to impose on us
the idea that he was in great strength, and to pin our troops to the
ground whilst his flanking movement became effective.</p>

<p>For this purpose the enemy had hurried forward a large force of
Artillery, composed of guns and howitzers of all calibres, escorted
and protected by four Cavalry Divisions and a limited number of <span lang="de">jäger</span>
battalions.</p>

<p>These troops were pushed forward against the 2nd Corps at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> as
they had been against the 1st Corps at <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>, and with a
precisely similar purpose.</p>

<p>The superb gallantry of the troops, and the skilful leading by
Divisional and Brigade and Battalion Commanders, helped very
materially by the support given by Allenby and, as I afterwards
learned, by <span lang="fr">Sordet</span> and <span lang="fr">d'Amade</span>, saved the 2nd Corps, which otherwise
would assuredly have been pinned to their ground and then surrounded.
The cavalry might have made good their retreat, but three out of five
Divisions of the British Army with the 7th Brigade must have been
lost.</p>

<p>The enemy, flushed by this primary victory, would have pressed in on
the flanks of the 1st Corps, cut off their retreat, and, continuing
his combined front and flank attack, would have almost certainly
pushed the whole Allied Army off their line of retreat, and a
stupendous repetition of Sedan might well have resulted.</p>

<p>The magnificent fight put up by these glorious troops saved disaster;
but the actual result was a total loss of at least 14,000 officers and
men, about 80 guns, numbers of machine guns, as well as quantities of
ammunition, war <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> material and baggage, whilst the enemy
gained time to close up his infantry columns marching down from the
north-east, at the cost of losses not greater than, if as great, as
our own, but which were, in view of the immense superiority he
possessed in numbers and fighting power, infinitely less important to
him.</p>

<p>The effect upon the British Army was to render the subsequent conduct
of the retreat more difficult and arduous.</p>

<p>The hope of making a stand behind the Somme or the Oise, or any other
favourable position north of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, had now to be abandoned owing
to the shattered condition of the Army, and the far-reaching effect of
our losses at the Battle of <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> was felt seriously even
throughout the subsequent Battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> and during the early
operations on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>. It was not possible to replace our lost guns
and machine guns until nearly the end of September.</p>

<p>In my dispatch, written in September, 1914, I refer eulogistically to
the Battle of <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>. I had been, together with my staff, directing
the movements of the British Army day and night up to the time of the
Battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>&mdash;in the course of which battle I received an
urgent demand from the Government that a dispatch should be forwarded.</p>

<p>It was completed, of necessity, very hurriedly, and before there had
been time or opportunity to give thorough study to the reports
immediately preceding and covering the period of that battle, by which
alone the full details could be disclosed.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, impossible, until much later on, to appreciate in all
its details the actual situation on the morning of August 26th.</p>

<p>At <span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span> the time the dispatch was written, indeed, I was entirely
ignorant of the material support which was rendered throughout the day
by Generals <span lang="fr">Sordet</span> and <span lang="fr">d'Amade</span>, and I accepted without question the
estimate made by the commander of the 2nd Corps as to the nature of
the threat against him and the position of the German forces opposed
to him.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for the uninitiated to realise the concentration
which the direction of an Army carrying out a vigorous offensive like
that of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, demands from the brain of the Commander-in-Chief,
if he is to make the best use of the forces under his command.</p>

<p>In the surroundings and under the conditions of a great battle, the
preparation of material for and the compilation of any dispatch is a
matter of great difficulty. It is very easy to say: "Why not employ
others?" I have always held that it is only the General who conducts
an operation of any magnitude who can, or should, sum up and describe
it. No one else can know what was passing in his mind, or how his
judgment was directed and formed by the swiftly moving procession of
events.</p>

<p>Nor can <span class="italic">exact</span> information become available for weeks or months,
sometimes, indeed, even for years, after the conclusion of a
particular series of operations.</p>

<p>In more than one of the accounts of the retreat from <span lang="fr">Mons</span>, it is
alleged that some tacit consent at least was given at Headquarters at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin to the decision arrived at by the commander of the 2nd
Corps. I owe it to the able and devoted officers of my Staff to say
that there is not a semblance of truth in this statement.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span></h3>

<h4>FURTHER COURSE OF THE RETREAT</h4>

<p>General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> had arranged for a conference at my Headquarters at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Quentin with <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> and myself, to take place early on the 26th.</p>

<p>I had reached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin at about 8 a.m. on the 25th. There had been
little sleep during the night for any of us. In the earlier hours
continual reports came in regarding the dangerous position of the 1st
Corps. In addition to the unfortunate but inevitable delay in
commencing their march in the morning, the troops were further greatly
embarrassed and worried by the retirement of the French from the
<span lang="fr">Sambre</span>, and their convergence on our own line of march.</p>

<p>The enemy's cavalry, supported by guns, <span lang="de">Jäger</span>, and detachments of
Infantry carried on motor cars and lorries, closely pressed our
columns through the <span lang="fr">Forêt de Mormal</span>. The result of this was to make it
imperative that the 2nd Division should make a firm stand at
<span lang="fr">Landrecies</span> and <span lang="fr">Maroilles</span> before the 1st Corps could reach the line
assigned to it in the morning. A gap of some eight miles existed
between the right of the 2nd Corps at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> and the left of the
1st Corps at <span lang="fr">Landrecies</span>.</p>

<p>The moment this news reached me I summoned <span lang="fr">Huguet</span>, and through him
dispatched an urgent request to two French Reserve Divisions (which
formed part of the 5th French Army and were nearest to the British) to
move up and assist Haig.</p>

<p>They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> readily responded, and the effect of the diversion
enabled Haig to extricate his Corps from this most dangerous
situation, which he did with great skill and judgment, whilst
inflicting severe loss on the enemy.</p>

<p>Towards morning it was reported to me that the enemy had drawn off,
and at dawn the retreat was resumed by the whole of the 1st Corps as
ordered. The fighting of the 1st Corps through this night, combined
with its skilful and efficient withdrawal in the morning, was one of
the most brilliant episodes of the whole retreat.</p>

<p>No sooner was my mind made easier by this happy deliverance of the 1st
Corps when the trouble related in the last chapter commenced with the
2nd Corps.</p>

<p>It was not until 8 a.m. on the 26th that I knew the left wing of the
Army was actually committed to the fight. At this time I was anxiously
awaiting the arrival of <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span>.</p>

<p>Staff Officers were sent to General Smith-Dorrien, carrying peremptory
orders to break off the action and to continue the retreat forthwith.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the French Commander-in-Chief arrived with his
Chief of Staff. He was followed by the Commander of the 5th French
Army, and we proceeded to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>I narrated the events of the previous two days, and pointed out the
isolated situation in which the British Army had been placed by the
very sudden change of plan and headlong retirement of the 5th French
Army on my right.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> appeared to treat the whole affair as quite normal, and
merely incidental to the common exigencies of war. He offered no
explanation, and gave no reason for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> the very unexpected
moves he had made. The discussion was apparently distasteful to him,
for he remained only a short time at my Headquarters, and left before
any satisfactory understanding as to further plans and dispositions
had been arrived at.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Joffre</span> remained with me some considerable time. I gathered that he was
by no means satisfied with the action and conduct of his subordinate
General. No very definite plans were then decided upon, the
understanding, as the French Commander-in-Chief left, being that the
retreat was to be continued as slowly and deliberately as possible,
until we found ourselves in a favourable position to make a firm stand
and take the offensive. The Commander-in-Chief urged me to maintain my
position in the line, which I told him I hoped, in spite of the heavy
losses which we had suffered, to be able to do.</p>

<p>Immediately <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> left I set out for Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien's
Headquarters, as I could get no satisfactory report from that General.
For the first few miles we were able to make fair progress, but as we
went on, the road got worse and worse, and sometimes we were
absolutely blocked for several minutes together.</p>

<p>The whole country-side was covered with refugees and their belongings,
whilst our own transport were endeavouring to make all the haste they
could to convey much needed food, ammunition and material to the
Divisions in front.</p>

<p>Several messages reached me on the road, and at last I got information
that Smith-Dorrien had broken off the action and that his columns were
once more on the march. He was only just in time, for subsequent
reports reached me during this motor journey of considerable Uhlan
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> patrols
in the neighbourhood, and towards evening <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin
itself was threatened by hostile cavalry, which, however, did not
succeed in entering the town.</p>

<p>On reaching Headquarters I found that more or less detailed reports
had arrived, which showed the shattered condition of the troops which
had fought at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>.</p>

<p>All idea of making any prolonged stand on the Somme south of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Quentin, which had during the day seriously entered my mind as a
possibility, was definitely abandoned.</p>

<p>The first necessity was to rally and collect the troops, which had
become mixed up and scattered by the trying experiences of the
previous days and nights. The great essential was to recover order,
restore confidence, and infuse fresh spirit with a clear aim in view.
To enable all this to be brought about we had first to look to the
cavalry. Orders were at once sent to Allenby to make such dispositions
as would effectually cover our rear and western flank. I told him he
was to enlist the co-operation of the French cavalry under <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>. The
Corps Commanders were ordered to move towards the line <span lang="fr">La Fère&mdash;Noyon</span>.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 26th, Headquarters were moved to <span lang="fr">Noyon</span>, where I
arrived late at night to consider the possibilities of making a stand
behind the Oise.</p>

<p>On the 27th the orders issued for the efficient conduct of the retreat
began to take effect, and the cavalry kept the enemy well at bay.</p>

<p>Smith-Dorrien reported himself in the early hours of the morning, and
later Major Dawnay (2nd Life Guards)&mdash;the recollection of whose
splendid and invaluable services until <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> he fell at the head
of his regiment will for ever remain with me&mdash;brought news of Haig's
progress, whilst Shea of the Indian cavalry&mdash;afterwards a renowned
leader of a Division at the front&mdash;told me of the valuable <span class="italic">rôle</span>
which was being so efficiently performed by the Cavalry.</p>

<p>In a telegram, which I communicated to the troops, General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> very
handsomely acknowledged what he described as the "invaluable" services
rendered to the Allied cause by the British Army throughout the past
few days.</p>

<p>It was a sincere gratification to the Army to see the generous terms
in which the French Commander-in-Chief expressed his appreciation.</p>

<p>I spent the early hours of the 27th in personally reconnoitring the
country bordering the south bank of the Oise, in the neighbourhood of
<span lang="fr">Noyon</span>.</p>

<p>The one idea which now possessed my mind was the possibility of making
a stand with the object of obtaining the necessary time for rest, and
to make good equipment and bring up reinforcements.</p>

<p>At first sight it appeared to me that the line of the Oise and its
tributary canalised waters offered such an opportunity.</p>

<p>The cursory examination of the ground which I was able to make on the
morning of the 27th satisfied me that it possessed decided
capabilities for a defence which was not intended to be prolonged, and
I thought, also, that the tortuous course of the river afforded some
alternative features, by availing ourselves of which a powerful
offensive might be commenced at the right time.</p>

<p>During the day I had another interview with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span>
took place before I had time to estimate the actual fighting
capabilities of the 2nd Corps and the 4th Division.</p>

<p>I was not even then fully aware of the terrible extent to which we had
suffered at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>. That these losses were heavy I never doubted,
but I had no idea, until many hours later, that they were such as must
paralyse for several days any movement in the direction of taking the
offensive.</p>

<p>My early morning deliberations were very much in accord with the view
of the French Commander-in-Chief. The proposal <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> then
communicated to me was that the Allied Armies should fall back on a
line, roughly, from Rheims on the east to <span lang="fr">Amiens</span> on the west, which
would bring the British Forces into the zone of country south of the
Oise, whose course I had already reconnoitred. We discussed the
situation thoroughly, and <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> was most sympathetic and
"understanding" in reference to our special position. He promised that
the 5th French Army should be directed to take energetic action to
relieve us from undue pressure by the enemy, and told me of his
projects for the formation of the 6th French Army on our left.</p>

<p>We parted without coming to any actual decision: for my part I could
give no promise until I knew exactly what I had to rely upon; whilst
energetic pursuit by the enemy might well prevent <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> rendering me
that support on both flanks which the situation imperatively demanded.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no more was heard of this project, and the idea
of standing on the above-mentioned line was abandoned.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th, General Headquarters moved <span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> to
<span lang="fr">Compiègne</span>, where we remained till the morning of the 31st.</p>

<p>It was during Friday the 28th that I fully realised the heavy losses
we had incurred. Since Sunday the 23rd this had reached, in officers
and men, the total of upwards of 15,000. The deficiency in armament
and equipment were equally serious. Roughly, some 80 guns and a large
proportion of our machine guns, besides innumerable articles of
necessary equipment and a large quantity of transport, had fallen into
the enemy's hands.</p>

<p>It became quite clear to me that no effective stand could be made
until we were able to improve our condition.</p>

<p>It was on this day that I received the assurance, the most welcome to
a commander in retreat, that the cavalry under Allenby's skilful
direction was effectively holding off the enemy's pursuit.</p>

<p>Gough with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin</span>, and Chetwode with
the 5th at <span lang="fr">Cérizy</span>, vigorously attacked the leading troops of the
German cavalry at both these places, and threw them back in confusion
and with heavy loss on to their main bodies.</p>

<p>On our left, <span lang="fr">d'Amade</span> with the two French Reserve Divisions, and <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>
with his Corps of cavalry, attacked the Germans in and around <span lang="fr">Péronne</span>.</p>

<p>Allenby's Headquarters were then at <span lang="fr">Cressy</span> (north-west of <span lang="fr">Noyon</span>), and
<span lang="fr">Sordet</span> called upon him for support in this enterprise.</p>

<p>Before arrangements could be made for such assistance the French were
driven back.</p>

<p>Although this attack failed to drive the Germans north, it was most
valuable and effective in checking the pursuit, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> and by their
vigorous action the troops of <span lang="fr">d'Amade</span> and <span lang="fr">Sordet</span> showed the stuff of
which the embryo 6th Army was being formed: that Army which a few days
later covered itself with imperishable glory on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> and <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>.</p>

<p>On our right there still appeared little encouragement to hope for an
early effective stand. The 5th French Army was in full retreat, the
Reserve Divisions, after fighting at <span lang="fr">Urvillers</span>, were retiring on the
<span lang="fr">Oise</span>, whilst the 18th Corps on their right was thrown back from
<span lang="fr">Itancourt</span> to the <span lang="fr">Oise</span> by a violent German attack.</p>

<p>I spent several hours of the 28th in going the round of the troops, as
it was possible to intercept various columns on the march or at their
temporary halts. I was able to get the men together on the roadside,
to thank them for the splendid work they had done, to tell them of the
gratitude of the French Commander-in-Chief, and the immense value of
the service they had rendered to the Allied cause. I charged them to
repeat all this to their comrades, and to spread it throughout the
units to which they belonged. There was neither time nor opportunity
for any formal inspection or set parade. The enemy was on our heels,
and there was little time to spare, but it touched me to the quick to
realise how, in the face of all the terrible demand made upon their
courage, strength and endurance, these glorious British soldiers
listened to the few words I was able to say to them with the spirit of
heroes and the confidence of children. It afforded me gratifying
evidence of the wonderful instinctive sympathy which has always
existed between the British soldier and his officer. These men had
seen how they had been <span class="italic">led</span>, they <span class="italic">knew</span> the far greater
proportionate loss suffered by their officers, they <span class="italic">felt</span> that they
trusted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> them and were ready to follow them anywhere. It is
this wonderful understanding between "leaders" and "led" which has
constituted the great strength and glory of the British Army
throughout all ages.</p>

<p>In all these roadside talks and confidences never did I hear one word
of complaint or breath of criticism. The spirit of discipline was as
palpably shown amongst these scattered groups of unkempt,
overstrained, tired soldiers, as on any "King's Birthday" Review ever
held on the Horse Guards Parade. Their one repeated question was:
"When shall we turn round and face them again?" And they would add:
"We can drive them to hell."</p>

<p>It was distressing, indeed, to look at some battalions, which I had
seen near <span lang="fr">Mons</span> only some three or four days earlier in all their fresh
glory and strength, now brought down to a handful of men and two or
three officers; but the glorious spirit I saw animating the men gave
me the keenest pleasure, and inspired a confidence which was of the
utmost help.</p>

<p>On this day I inspected a large proportion of the transport of both
Army Corps, which I found in a much better condition than could have
been thought possible.</p>

<p>I did not reach my Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> until five. I found
<span lang="fr">Huguet</span> waiting for me with a Staff Officer of the 7th French Army
Corps, which was to form part of the new 6th French Army. It was from
the talk I had with them that I learnt how <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> was forming the new
6th Army.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Huguet</span> informed me that a considerable force was being railed round
from <span lang="fr">Verdun</span> to <span lang="fr">Amiens</span>, and that the new Army would be commanded by
General <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span>. I knew nothing then of the French
Commander-in-Chief's ultimate plans, and I doubt if at that moment he
had been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> able to formulate any decided line of action. At
this particular time I think the unprepared condition of Paris loomed
largely in his mind, and that his original intention with regard to
the 6th Army was most probably to make further provision for the
protection of the capital.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Joffre</span> had particularly asked me to undertake the Air reconnaissance
on the western flank of the Allied forces.</p>

<p>Our Intelligence Service had been admirably organised, and was working
most effectively under the able direction of Brigadier-General
Macdonogh. I cannot speak too highly of the skill and ability
displayed by this distinguished officer throughout the whole time
during which we served together. His service was invaluable; his
ingenuity and resource in obtaining and collecting information, his
indefatigable brain, and the unfailing versatility and insight with
which he sifted every statement and circumstance were beyond all
praise. He trained an excellent Staff who valued his leadership, for
he had an extraordinary power of getting the most and best work out of
everyone. His information as to the enemy's movements were remarkably
accurate, and placed me throughout in the best position to interpret
the enemy's probable intentions.</p>

<p>During my stay at <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> all appreciations of the situation pointed
to the immediate investment of Paris by the right wing of the German
Army as being the enemy's first objective.</p>

<p>It is fairly certain that the concentration of an important new Army
on the western flank of the British, to the north of Paris, was quite
unknown to the Germans, and did not enter into their calculations
until some days later.</p>

<p>We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> had also the best reason for believing that the German
Higher Command regarded the British Forces as shattered and almost
useless, at any rate so far as any effort which we could make for the
defence of Paris was concerned. In fact, believing the capital to be
practically at its mercy, the right wing of the German Army was
blindly marching into a veritable hornet's nest, in spite of the
backward condition of the Paris defence.</p>

<p>On the 29th a very brilliant and successful attack by the French 5th
Army at Guise heavily defeated three German Army Corps and threw them
back with severe loss. This had a great effect in assisting the
retreat, for it not only enabled the 5th Army to hold its own for some
time on the <span lang="fr">Oise</span>, between <span lang="fr">Guise</span> and <span lang="fr">La Fère</span>, but it considerably
relieved hostile pressure on the British and on the French troops on
our left.</p>

<p>From <span lang="fr">Roye</span> on the west, <span lang="fr">Montdidier, Noyon, La Fère, Guise</span>, up to <span lang="fr">Hirson</span>
on the east, the heads of the Allied columns were established, well
covered by their advanced cavalry.</p>

<p>Throughout this day reports often contradictory and conflicting
reached me. It was quite clear that our position on the Oise was being
dangerously threatened by superior forces, and I felt it to be
impossible to stand on that line even until we could make good some of
our heavy losses, and I could not hope to get anything up for several
days to come.</p>

<p>With great reluctance I ordered the retreat to be continued to the
line of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> from <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> to <span lang="fr">Soissons</span>, but in view of the knock
given to the enemy at Guise by the 5th French Army, and the desire
expressed by General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> that the Allied forces should hold their
ground <span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span> as long as possible and only retire when necessary, I
directed commanders to carry out their marches with all deliberation,
and to take advantage of every opportunity to check the enemy's
advance.</p>

<p>It now became known to the Allied Command that the enemy had detached
a considerable force to his eastern frontier, where he was being
seriously threatened by the Russians. <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s natural desire to
profit by this, coupled with his fears for the safety of Paris, made
him very anxious to take the offensive at the earliest possible
moment. He came to see me on the afternoon of the 29th August at
<span lang="fr">Compiègne</span>, and urged these views upon me. I remained firm in my
absolute conviction that the British forces could not effectively
fulfil their share in such action for some days, and that, so far as
we were concerned, a further retreat was inevitable. I assured the
French Commander-in-Chief that no serious gap should be made in his
line by any premature or hasty retirement, but I imperatively demanded
the necessary time to refit and obtain reinforcements.</p>

<p>I strongly represented to <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> the advantage of drawing the German
armies on still further from their base, even although we had to move
south of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>. Indeed, the ideas which I afterwards expressed at
the British Embassy in Paris to M. Millerand, the French Minister of
War, in the presence of Lord Kitchener, were the same which I had in
my mind during this interview with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, namely, that our stand
should be made on some line between the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> and the <span lang="fr">Seine</span>.</p>

<p>The French Army was still in full retreat. The 6th French Army on our
left was not yet formed, and the Commander-in-Chief had put no
definite plan of attack before me, with an assigned <span class="italic">rôle</span> which he
desired me <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> to fulfil. All he asked me to do was to remain in
the line and fill up the gap between the 5th and 6th Armies. This I
had every intention of doing.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that I had to make this decision in the face of
resistance from some of my subordinate commanders, who took a
depressed view as to the condition of their troops. When I discussed
the situation at a meeting of British commanders held at <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span>,
Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien expressed it as his opinion that the only
course open to us was to retire to our base, thoroughly refit,
re-embark and try to land at some favourable point on the coast-line.
I refused to listen to what was the equivalent of a counsel of
despair.</p>

<p>Our communications with <span lang="fr">Havre</span> being now dangerously threatened, it
became necessary to effect a change of base and establish a fresh
line. <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nazaire</span> and <span lang="fr">Nantes</span> were fixed upon, with Le Mans as advanced
base.</p>

<p>The morning of the 30th found our cavalry with two brigades to the
north-west of <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span>, one to the north and one to the north-east.
The 5th, under Chetwode, covered the retirement of the 1st Corps. Our
line that night was through <span lang="fr">Nampiel</span> on the west to <span lang="fr">Coucy-le-Château</span>.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Huguet</span> to-day communicated to me <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s new dispositions. He was
retiring the 5th French Army to the line of the <span lang="fr">Serre</span>, their left on
<span lang="fr">La Fère</span>; their right on the left of the 4th French Army towards
Rethel. The 6th French Army was to fall back to the line
<span lang="fr">Compiègne&mdash;Clermont</span>. <span lang="fr">Sordet</span>'s Cavalry Corps was to be on the left of
the line.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Joffre</span> sent an urgent request to me to destroy the bridges over the
<span lang="fr">Oise</span> between <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> and <span lang="fr">La Fère</span>.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Huguet</span> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> once more pressed upon me <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s urgent desire that
I should remain and fill the gap between <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> and <span lang="fr">La Fère</span>. In
reply I again repeated emphatically what I had previously stated,
namely, that I could be in no condition to stand and fight for several
days, and therefore I could not consent to fill any portion of a
"fighting" line. I was fully prepared to continue the retreat slowly
and deliberately, retaining my present position between the 5th and
6th Armies.</p>

<p>Now, as before, the view I took of my responsibilities, in accordance
with my interpretation of the "special instructions" given me, guided
my deliberations in these difficult days.</p>

<p>I could not forget that the 5th French Army had commenced to retreat
from the <span lang="fr">Sambre</span> at least 24 hours before I had been given any official
intimation that <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s offensive plan had been abandoned. I knew
that it was alone due to the vast superiority of our cavalry over that
of the enemy, and to the splendid tenacity and the superior marching
and fighting powers of our troops, that we had been saved from
overwhelming disaster. My duty to my country demanded that I should
risk no recurrence of such a situation, and I determined that our
needs and the interests of our Empire must be duly weighed and
balanced in the councils of the Supreme Headquarters Staff.</p>

<p>I despatched a letter to Lord Kitchener on this day, in which the
following passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel very seriously the absolute necessity for retaining in my
hands complete independence of action and power to retire towards my
base should circumstances render it necessary."</p>

<p>On this day Pulteney arrived, and the formation of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> 3rd
Army Corps under his command was commenced forthwith. It was composed
of the 4th Division and the 19th Brigade, with some mounted troops
temporarily attached, pending the arrival of the 6th Division, which
had now been ordered to France.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 31st, Headquarters were moved to <span lang="fr">Dammartin</span>.
After riding round to see whatever troops I could, we reached there
early in the afternoon. <span lang="fr">Huguet</span> was waiting for me with more
information and messages from <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>. The demand that we should stand
and fight was not only urgently repeated, but was actually backed by
imperative messages from the French President, and from Lord Kitchener
and the British Government, yet at this very moment <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> was
actually throwing back the left flank of the 5th Army and widening the
gap between us. At the same time Lord Kitchener was assuring the Home
Government that our losses were comparatively small, and that all
deficiencies had been made good.</p>

<p>I retain the most profound belief that, had I yielded to these violent
solicitations, the whole Allied Army would have been thrown back in
disorder over the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and Paris would have fallen an easy prey into
the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the danger of the situation as it
existed. Neither on this day nor for several subsequent days did one
man, horse, gun, or machine gun reach me to make good deficiencies.</p>

<p>I refused. This brought Lord Kitchener to Paris, where I met him on
September 1st at the British Embassy. I went there with my Chief of
Staff at his urgent request, regarding him as a representative of His
Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> deeply resented being called away from my Headquarters at
so critical a time. Two important actions were fought by considerable
detachments of the Army under my command during this day, over which
there was no one to exercise any co-ordinating control. Either might
have easily brought on a general engagement.</p>

<p>The interview had one important result. M. Millerand (the War
Minister) and M. Viviani (the Prime Minister) were present at the
Conference, and before them all I was able to give a clear exposition
of my views as to the future conduct of the Allied operations.</p>

<p>M. Millerand undertook to lay this document before General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> at
once. This great statesman and invaluable servant of his country
occupied the post of War Minister during most of the time I was in
France. His invariable kindness and courtesy, coupled with his skilful
and astute appreciation of the military situation throughout all its
difficult and varying periods, will always be gratefully remembered by
me.</p>

<p>The result of my proposals will be the better understood if I quote
General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s reply to the War Minister, and a personal letter
which I received from the Commander-in-Chief on the same subject.</p>

<p class="left60">(Signed) <span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap">French</span>."</span></p>

<p>I touch with some diffidence on less agreeable features of this
memorable discussion in Paris.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener arrived on this occasion in the uniform of a Field
Marshal, and from the outset of his conversation assumed the air of a
Commander-in-Chief, and announced his intention of taking the field
and inspecting the troops.</p>

<p>On hearing this, the British Ambassador (Sir Francis, now Lord,
Bertie) at once emphatically objected, and drafted a telegram to the
Foreign Secretary stating clearly and unmistakably his views, and
demanding instructions. He gave this despatch to Lord Kitchener to
read. The latter then asked for my opinion, and I said my views on the
subject coincided entirely with those of the Ambassador.</p>

<p>After some discussion, the Secretary of State decided to abandon his
intention, and the telegram to Sir Edward Grey was not sent. In the
conversation which followed between us all, Lord Kitchener appeared to
take grave exception to certain views which I expressed as to the
expediency of leaving the direction of the operations in the field in
the hands of the military chiefs in command in the field.</p>

<p>He abruptly closed the discussion and requested me to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span>
accompany him for a private interview in another room.</p>

<p>When we were alone he commenced by entering a strong objection to the
tone I assumed. Upon this I told him all that was in my mind. I said
that the command of the British Forces in France had been entrusted to
me by His Majesty's Government; that I alone was responsible to them
for whatever happened, and that on French soil my authority as regards
the British Army must be supreme until I was legally superseded by the
same authority which had put that responsibility upon me. I further
remarked that Lord Kitchener's presence in France in the character of
a soldier could have no other effect than to weaken and prejudice my
position in the eyes of the French and my own countrymen alike. I
reminded him of our service in the field together some 13 years
before, and told him that I valued highly his advice and assistance,
which I would gladly accept as such, but that I would not tolerate any
interference with my executive command and authority so long as His
Majesty's Government chose to retain me in my present position. I
think he began to realise my difficulties, and we finally came to an
amicable understanding.</p>

<p>Important telegrams and messages were then brought me, and I told Lord
Kitchener that it was impossible for me to absent myself any longer
from my Headquarters, whither I at once repaired with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for any but soldiers to understand the real
bearing and significance of this Paris incident. If the confidence of
the troops in their commander is shaken in the least degree, or if his
influence, power and authority are prejudiced by any display of
distrust in his ability to conduct operations, however slight the
indications of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> such distrust may be, the effect reacts
instantly throughout the whole Army. This is more than ever true with
troops which, as at the moment in question, were being subjected to
great and severe demands upon their courage, endurance, and, above
all, <span class="italic">faith in their leaders</span>.</p>

<p>Then again there was the effect which might have been produced on the
French. Ministers and Generals were present and witnessed Lord
Kitchener's apparent assertion of his right to exercise the power and
authority of a Commander-in-Chief in the Field.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the incident terminated in a manner which led to no
regrettable publicity. Lord Kitchener realised his mistake and left
Paris that night.</p>

<p>I did not reach my Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Dammartin</span> until about 7 in the
evening of September 1st. Two important rearguard actions had been
fought during the day, one at <span lang="fr">Néry</span>&mdash;where Captain Bradbury was killed,
whilst "L" battery fought heroically against overwhelming odds&mdash;and
the other at <span lang="fr">Villers-Cotterets</span>.</p>

<p>The proximity of the enemy, and the close presence of detachments of
hostile cavalry with guns, which had broken through our line, required
the retirement of my Headquarters to <span lang="fr">Lagny</span> on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>. As it was
necessary to move with precaution, this place was not reached until 1
a.m. on the 2nd.</p>

<p>I have already reproduced the communications from General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> under
date September 2nd, in connection with the Paris interview on the 1st.
Although I did not receive these documents until late on the 2nd, they
indicated the ideas which occupied my own mind on that day, namely,
the defence of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> with a view to a subsequent offensive.</p>

<p>On <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> this day I also received a letter from the Governor of
Paris which, with my reply, run as follows:&mdash;</p>

<span class="left50">"Yours most sincerely,</span><br>
<span class="left40">(Signed)<span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap">French</span>,</span> Field Marshal,</span><br>
<span class="left40">"Commander-in-Chief, British Forces."</span></p>

<p>From <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> these documents it will be seen that the safety of the
capital was the paramount thought in the minds of the French Generals.</p>

<p>On September 2nd, the 5th French Army on my right and the 6th on my
left were retiring on <span lang="fr">Chateau-Thiérry</span> and <span lang="fr">Paris</span> respectively, whilst
our own troops reached the line of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> towards <span lang="fr">Lagny</span> and <span lang="fr">Meaux</span>.
The 4th Division was, however, delayed by a small rearguard action and
passed the night south of <span lang="fr">Dammartin</span>.</p>

<p>I had spent the greater part of the day in carefully reconnoitring the
best defensive positions south of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and to these points the
British forces were directed to move on the following day, destroying
the bridges after they had passed.</p>

<p>By early morning of September 3rd, General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s letter (quoted
above) had reached me, by which I judged that, whilst generally
agreeing in my views, the General did not think it advisable to
attempt a deliberate defence of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>. On this, the orders given
to the British troops on the night of the 2nd were modified, and they
were directed to continue their march to the line
<span lang="fr">Montry&mdash;Crécy&mdash;Coulommiers</span>.</p>

<p>Reinforcements of all kinds were ordered up to these points and were
well on their way, but the railways were badly blocked and there was
much delay.</p>

<p>I must now turn to the discussion of important information which began
to reach us on the afternoon of the 3rd regarding the movements of the
enemy.</p>

<p>It appeared that a direct advance on Paris by the German right wing
was no longer intended. They were reported to be moving in large
columns south-east and east. A few regiments were said to be moving
east by train. Later on, further reports arrived that the country in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> our front for several miles north of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> was clear of
the enemy. No less than four German Corps were said to be
concentrating on <span lang="fr">Chateau-Thiérry</span> and to the east along the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and
it was reported that they had begun an attack on the 5th French Army.
The latest information told us that <span lang="fr">Chateau-Thiérry</span> was in the hands
of the enemy, and that the 5th French Army was retiring south to the
<span lang="fr">Seine</span>.</p>

<p>The ideas underlying this concentration on their centre by the enemy
look as if it was based on a totally wrong appreciation of our
situation. The Germans were ignorant of the real strength which was
gathering north of Paris in the formation of the 6th French Army. They
regarded the British Army as practically crushed, and almost useless
as a fighting force.</p>

<p>Relying upon this, they had no hesitation in leaving what they thought
were the remnants of the Allied forces immediately north and east of
the Paris fortifications to be dealt with by such of their own forces
as were operating through <span lang="fr">Amiens</span> and on their extreme right. The
German Higher Command then decided to strike with overwhelming force
at the Allied centre south of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> and to cut our Armies in two.</p>

<p>The first necessity for the enemy was a quick decision by a great
victory to be achieved at once. They were out-marching their supplies;
there was Russia to be crushed and their eastern frontier to be
secured; and, further, a prolonged campaign was what they desired to
avoid at all costs. The desperate attempt was no sooner fairly
launched than the fatal error of over-confidence and the folly of
under-rating one's enemy stared them in the face with all its
stupendous consequences, as west of the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span> the country was seen to
blaze along its whole length <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> with the fire of the French
75's, whilst the British and 5th French Armies, now at bay, threw the
enemy back in confusion over the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>.</p>

<p>With their usual arrogance and pomposity the Germans, ignoring the
fact that it was their own negligence which had led them into a most
dangerous situation, claim that General von Kluck showed unusual skill
in extricating the 1st German Army from the toils.</p>

<p>After considering the subject very carefully, and with a thorough
knowledge of the situation and the ground, I have formed the opinion
that von Kluck manifested considerable hesitation and want of energy.</p>

<p>The rear section of the British General Staff had been established
during this day at <span lang="fr">Melun</span>, on the <span lang="fr">Seine</span>. The leading section remained
with me at <span lang="fr">Mortcerf</span>, which became my advanced Headquarters.</p>

<p>Information which arrived during the 4th confirmed all our
anticipations of the previous day, and, in the evening at <span lang="fr">Melun</span>,
messages reached me from <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> that he was formulating his new plan.</p>

<p>I had spent most of the day at advanced Headquarters, and had passed
some time with Haig near <span lang="fr">Coulommiers</span>. It seemed likely, by the
direction of the German advance, that the 1st Corps might be attacked,
and Haig had retired his 2nd Division in line with the 1st and was
preparing for any eventuality. I conversed with him for a considerable
time on the state of his troops, about which he expressed some
anxiety. He said they stood in urgent need of rest and refitment, but
as usual he was full of fight and ready to meet any emergency.</p>

<p>Whilst I was with Haig, Smith-Dorrien arrived.</p>

<p>The British Army had, indeed, suffered severely, and had performed an
herculean task in reaching its present position <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> in such
fighting form, and its moral had withstood the ordeal.</p>

<p>I think the Germans were probably justified in doubting our offensive
powers, but the thing they forgot was the nation from which we spring.</p>

<p>On my return to <span lang="fr">Melun</span> on this night (September 4th) I found that
Murray had received a visit from General Gallieni, Governor of Paris,
who had communicated <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s plans for my consideration.</p>

<p>He wished the 6th French Army to recross the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> between <span lang="fr">Lagny</span> and
<span lang="fr">Meaux</span> on Sunday the 6th, and then to take up a position facing east
towards the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>. He asked me to fill up the space between the right
of the 6th Army (on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>) and the left of the 5th Army (near
<span lang="fr">Provins</span>). He then intended the whole of the Allied Armies to advance
east, north-east, and north, and endeavour to crush the German Corps
operating between us.</p>

<p>General <span lang="fr">Franchet d'Esperey</span> had now superseded <span lang="fr">Lanrezac</span> in command of
the 5th Army. I had sent Wilson (Sub-Chief of the General Staff) to
him on the previous day, and to-night he returned and told me that
<span lang="fr">d'Esperey</span> was making similar plans.</p>

<p>I must say a word here with regard to Henry Wilson. I have known him
for many years. He possesses a striking personality. In appearance
very tall and spare, his frame is surmounted by a face in which one
sees great intelligence and power, combined with a very kindly and
humorous expression. In looking at him it is impossible not to realise
the strength of will and character which he undoubtedly possesses. His
appearance does not belie him, he is all that he looks. Not one of his
many friends has had a more thorough experience of him than <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span>
I, both in "Sunshine and Shadow." However dark the surroundings,
however desperate the situation, however gloomy the prospect, his fine
humour, splendid courage and high spirit are always the same.</p>

<p>In those many weary, anxious days we passed together during my term of
command in France, I cherish a most grateful remembrance of his
unfailing and invaluable help, as well as of his sincere, loyal, and
wholehearted support. Of iron nerve and frame, nothing seemed to tire
him. Having passed through the Staff College early in life with high
honours, he was marked out for the most important Staff work; and
after filling many important minor positions with distinction he
became Commandant of the Staff College, where his great talents were
employed in reforming and much improving that institution. His <span class="italic">magnum
opus</span> in peace time was done when he was Director of Military
Operations at the War Office during the four years preceding the War.
His countrymen have never realised, and probably may never know, the
vital importance and invaluable results of the work he did there, not
only in regard to the share he took in the preparation of the
Expeditionary Force, but also in establishing those happy relations
with the French Army which have proved of such help to Allied
operations throughout the War.</p>

<p>Fearing no man, it was the very essence of his nature to speak his
mind openly on all occasions, and when the great Irish crisis in the
spring of 1914 was at its height, he sided openly with his native
Ulster. He accompanied me to France as Sub-Chief of the General Staff,
and when Murray's health broke down, in January 1915, I selected
Wilson as his successor; but, owing to his candid expression of
opinion in the Irish embroglio, he had many enemies, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> and his
appointment was vetoed. It was this bad luck alone which prevented his
valuable services then being used for his country's benefit in the
best direction, and in a position for which he was better qualified
than anyone else.</p>

<p>But to return to my story.</p>

<p>I somewhat feared the gap which existed between my right and
<span lang="fr">d'Esperey</span>'s left, although the cavalry under Allenby at <span lang="fr">Garatin</span> were
on this flank. Because of this, and also because the Germans were
exercising some pressure on Haig on this night (September 4th), I
ordered the British Forces to retire a few miles further south.</p>

<p>This facilitated the movements of reinforcements, supplies and
material, which were coming up fast.</p>

<p>I have now brought the story down to September 5th, the last day of
the great German advance. The British forces had halted on the
previous night on a line facing nearly east and extending from
<span lang="fr">Villers-sur-Morin</span> on the north to <span lang="fr">Fontenay</span> on the south. The 5th
French Army lay east of my right flank on an east and west line
through <span lang="fr">Provins</span>, facing north. The 6th Army was on my left, preparing
to recross the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> between <span lang="fr">Lagny</span> and <span lang="fr">Meaux</span>.</p>

<p>I was at <span lang="fr">Melun</span> early in the morning. <span lang="fr">Huguet</span> had arrived in the night
with despatches and a Staff Officer from <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, with whom I held a
long conference.</p>

<p>It appeared that the 6th Army had already crossed the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and would
be in position west of the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span> at 9 a.m. on the 6th, on which day
the French Commander-in-Chief proposed that the whole Allied Army
should advance to the attack.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards General <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span>, commanding the 6th French Army,
arrived, and we proceeded to discuss the situation fully. He described
in detail what he intended <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> doing, which was almost exactly
as I have explained above. He thought that very few of the enemy still
remained north of Paris, his cavalry having reconnoitred for some
distance north and north-west. He expressed it as his intention to
attack most vigorously (<span class="italic" lang="fr">au fond</span>), and asked for my best support,
which I promised to give.</p>

<p>I despatched Murray at once to visit the Corps and Cavalry Commanders
and ascertain exactly the condition of their troops. He returned later
in the day with very favourable reports. All were in excellent spirits
and eager for the advance. They were having some much-needed rest;
whilst reinforcements both of men and material were beginning to
arrive.</p>

<p>Reports received during the day confirmed all we had previously heard.
The enemy's concentration against the centre of our line was complete.
They had crossed the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> at several points, and their advanced
troops had been engaged during the past night and this day with our
cavalry and 1st Army Corps on our right, and along the entire front of
the 5th French Army.</p>

<p>Later in the day <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> came to <span lang="fr">Melun</span>, and I had a long conference
with him. We again went over all plans, and it was definitely arranged
that the attack was to commence all along the line next day, the 6th.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Joffre</span> was full of enthusiasm, and very hopeful of success if we all
fulfilled our respective <span class="italic">rôles</span> and attacked <span class="italic" lang="fr">au fond</span>.</p>

<p>Thus ended the "Great Retreat."</p>

<p class="p2">In these pages I have avoided as far as possible any detailed account
of the many splendid engagements which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span> have added new and
undying laurels to the battle rolls of all the distinguished regiments
which fought them.</p>

<p>I repeat that the main cause of the success, which prepared this vast
battle ground and opened the way for the decisive battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>,
is to be found in the able dispositions made by the leaders; the
magnificent example set by officers and non-commissioned officers; and
in the wonderful spirit, courage, and endurance which was displayed by
the rank and file of the Army.</p>

<p>My main object in writing this record is to explain as clearly as
possible to my countrymen the line of thought which was in my own
mind, the objects I set out to attain, and the reasons why I directed
the troops as I did and came to the decisions at which I arrived at
each successive phase of the operations.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter I am anxious to lay particular stress on a
principle which seems to me of the utmost importance, namely, the
danger of undue interference by the Government at home with the
Commander of an Army in the field. Stanton's interference with
McClellan in the American Civil War should have been a sufficient
warning.</p>

<p>I have referred to the natural anxiety which was deeply felt by the
French President, Government, and Generals for the safety of Paris.</p>

<p>The utmost pressure was brought to bear upon me to alter my
dispositions so as to make a dangerous stand on lines and in places
which, in my judgment, would have exposed the British Army to the
greatest danger of annihilation.</p>

<p>The shattered condition of my troops was not realised, but perhaps in
view of the situation such pressure was natural and inevitable.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> had the power, in accordance with the instructions which I
had received before coming to France, to use my full discretion in
agreeing to or resisting such demands, and in all my happy experience
of them, never did I find my French comrades resentful of such
resistance when they realised the true reason for it.</p>

<p>But when, in spite of my earnest representation of the true condition
of affairs, the Secretary of State for War himself and the Government
with him, brought still greater pressure to bear, backed by the
authority they possessed, to enforce their views, I was placed in a
position of the utmost difficulty.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener came to Paris with no other object than to insist upon
my arresting the retreat, although no sign of a halt appeared at any
part of the Allied line.</p>

<p>He was ignorant of the condition of the Army as I knew it, and was
mistaken in his assertion that reinforcements of men and material had
already reached me. The impression conveyed by his visit was that I
had greatly magnified the losses which had occurred, and exaggerated
the condition of the troops. It was difficult to resist such pressure.</p>

<p>Fortunately I was able to do so.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="6">VI</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE</h4>

<p>When day dawned on the ever memorable morning of September 6th, 1914,
some ray of the great hopes in which I had indulged during the first
two or three days at my Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> seemed to revive.
Taught now by a bitter experience, I felt more than ever the necessity
of being prepared for anything. There was much, however, to inspire
confidence. Great changes had been made amongst the higher commanders
in the army of our Allies. The finest military leaders of France were
now heading the splendid soldiers of that truly martial nation, and we
had all learnt most valuable and practical lessons in the hard school
of adversity.</p>

<p>The latest reports showed that French and British soldiers alike were
animated by the highest spirit and meant to "do or die." As regards
the British Army, reinforcements had arrived, deficiencies in armament
and material had been partially made good, and, most important of all,
the promise of an immediate advance against the enemy had sent a
thrill of exultation and enthusiasm throughout the whole force. A
modicum of rest had also been secured.</p>

<p>As I have said before, it is not my purpose in these pages to write a
history. Many volumes have been published with this object. They have
appeared in many countries and in many languages. A few have seemed to
me to be wonderfully accurate accounts, considering <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> the
great difficulty of arriving at the truth long before the time when
full and authentic material can possibly be available.</p>

<p>All I have had in my mind in writing this book is to explain, so far
as I can, my own part throughout these great events in carrying out
the responsible task entrusted to me by my country; the aspect in
which the situation presented itself in my mind from day to day; and
my reasons for the decisions which guided the action of the troops
under my command.</p>

<p>My desire here is to recall exactly what was in my mind on the morning
of the 6th September, which saw the opening of the Battle of the
<span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and to describe the <span class="italic">view</span> which presented itself to me of the
situation on both sides; in other words, the basis for the orders
which were issued to the troops.</p>

<p>These orders were necessarily founded upon my own personal
appreciation of the situation as it appeared to me at the moment. It
was impossible for me to know that situation accurately in all its
details. For instance, I could not then know, as I know now, that the
Germans had abandoned their vigorous offensive 24 hours earlier than
this, nor should I have conceived it possible that they could have
done so.</p>

<p>Reverting, then, to my general view of things on the morning of the
6th; in the first place, my personal conference with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> on the
night of the 5th had put me in full possession of his exact plans and
all that was in his mind.</p>

<p>His intention was to attack at all points <span class="italic" lang="fr">au fond</span>, to inflict a
crushing defeat on the whole German Army on our front by assailing its
flank with the 6th French and British Armies attacking from a line
running roughly from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> <span lang="fr">Le Plessis-Belleville</span> on the north
through <span lang="fr">Cuisy&mdash;Iverny&mdash;Neufmontiers&mdash;Meaux</span>, across the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> to
<span lang="fr">Villers-sur-Morin&mdash;Rozoy&mdash;la Chapelle Iger</span> to <span lang="fr">Gastins</span> on the south.</p>

<p>At the same time the 5th French Army was to advance north from its
present position and, with all the French Armies to its right,
<span lang="fr">Franchet d'Esperey</span> was to make a simultaneous frontal attack.</p>

<p>The following were General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s orders of September 4th:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Advantage must be taken of the risky situation of the German 1st
Army to concentrate against it the efforts of the Allied Armies on our
extreme left. All preparations must be made during the 5th for an
attack on the 6th September.</p>

<p>2. The following general arrangements are to be carried out by the
evening of September 5th:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left10">(<span class="italic">a</span>) All the available forces of the 6th Army north-east of
     <span lang="fr">Meaux</span> are to be ready to cross the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span> between <span lang="fr">Lizy</span> and
     <span lang="fr">May-en-Multien</span>, in the general direction of <span lang="fr">Château-Thiérry</span>. The
     available portions of the 1st Cavalry Corps which are close at
     hand are to be handed over to General <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> for this
     operation.</p>

<p class="left10">(<span class="italic">b</span>) The British Army is to establish itself on the line
     <span lang="fr">Changis&mdash;Coulommiers</span>, facing east, ready to attack in the general
     direction of <span lang="fr">Montmirail</span>.</p>

<p class="left10">(<span class="italic">c</span>) The 5th Army will close slightly on its left and take up
     the general line <span lang="fr">Courtaçon&mdash;Esternay&mdash;Sézanne</span>, ready to attack,
     generally speaking, from south to north. The 2nd Cavalry Corps
     will ensure connection between the British Army and the 5th Army.</p>

<p class="left10">(<span class="italic">d</span>) The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> 9th Army will cover the right of the 5th Army
     by holding the southern outlets of the <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gond</span> marshes and by
     placing part of its forces on the tableland north of <span lang="fr">Sézanne</span>.</p>

<p>3. These different armies are to attack on the morning of September
6th.</p>

<p>The 8th Division of the 4th French Corps was to arrive south of <span lang="fr">Meaux</span>
during the early morning and maintain connection with the British 3rd
Corps about <span lang="fr">Villers-sur-Morin</span>, whence the British line following the
points named above was facing nearly due east.</p>

<p>My own view of the enemy's situation and intentions was fairly in
accordance with the Germans' actual positions, although I did not know
at that time that a retreat had really set in, or how the various
Corps and Divisions were placed. Judging from the Air and Cavalry
reconnaissances and from Intelligence Reports, I thought that a large
part of von Kluck's 1st Army was now south of the <span lang="fr">Grand Morin</span> River,
and that the enemy's western columns had crossed the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> about <span lang="fr">Meaux</span>
and <span lang="fr">Trilport</span>, although one or two Divisions were still north of that
river and west of the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>. From the fact that the rearguards of both
my 1st and 2nd Corps in their retirement on the day previous were
slightly engaged, whilst a few outpost affairs were reported as having
occurred in the night, I judged the enemy to have got some distance
south of the Grand Morin River. The appearance of hostile cavalry
detachments on the previous evening indicated the presence of that
arm.</p>

<p>Whilst it appeared to me that our dispositions promised great things,
I also realised fully that the situation demanded the utmost care and
watchfulness, as everything depended on the timing of our movements,
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> utmost measure of mutual support, and the most vigorous
and continuous attacks.</p>

<p>The area in which the British Army operated in the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>
may be described as the country enclosed between the tributaries of
the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span> on the north and the Grand Morin on the south,
between which boundaries it is intersected by the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> itself, and a
third tributary, the <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span>.</p>

<p>This area forms the western portion of the Plateau de la Brie, which
rises to a height of 400 to 500 feet above the plain of Champagne. The
general slope of the ground is from east to west. The plateau is of
rock formation, and the rivers, which were formerly of greater volume
than at present, have worn away deep channels, with the result that
the ground falls very steeply to the river-beds. A certain amount of
alluvial deposit has been brought down by the rivers and streams, in
the immediate vicinity of which are to be found marshy pools and
swamps. With the exception of the <span lang="fr">Forêt de Crécy</span>, to the south-west of
the area under consideration, there are no extensive woods, the higher
ground being covered with small copses of thick undergrowth with a
sprinkling of oak.</p>

<p>The country generally is open, and presents no obstacles to the
passage of troops of all arms. The steep cliffs rising abruptly from
the river-beds afford good defensive positions suitable for rearguard
actions, obliging an advancing force to concentrate at defiles.</p>

<p>The roads and railways follow generally the course of the rivers.</p>

<p>The chief roads are&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">a</span>) <span lang="fr">Paris&mdash;Meaux&mdash;La Ferté-sous-Jouarre</span>, where one branch continues
through <span lang="fr">Montmirail</span> to <span lang="fr">Châlons</span>, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> other bends slightly
north through <span lang="fr">Château-Thiérry</span> and <span lang="fr">Dormans</span> to <span lang="fr">Rheims</span> and <span lang="fr">Epernay</span>.</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">b</span>) <span lang="fr">Paris&mdash;Lagny&mdash;Coulommiers&mdash;La Ferté-Gaucher&mdash;Esternay</span>.</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">c</span>) <span lang="fr">Soissons&mdash;Villers-Cotterets&mdash;Meaux</span>, and thence through the <span lang="fr">Forêt
de Crécy</span> to <span lang="fr">Melun</span>.</p>

<p>The chief railways are&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <span lang="fr">Paris&mdash;Nanteuil&mdash;Crépy-en-Valois</span>, thence to <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> and
<span lang="fr">Soissons</span>.</p>

<p>(2) <span lang="fr">Paris&mdash;Meaux&mdash;Rheims</span> (following the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>).</p>

<p>(3) <span lang="fr">Paris&mdash;Meaux&mdash;Château-Thiérry&mdash;Epernay</span> (following the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>).</p>

<p>(4) <span lang="fr">Paris&mdash;Tournan</span>, through the <span lang="fr">Forêt de Crécy</span> to <span lang="fr">Coulommiers</span>, and
thence to <span lang="fr">Esternay</span> (following the <span lang="fr">Grand Morin</span>).</p>

<p>In addition to the roads mentioned above, which are <span class="italic" lang="fr">routes
nationales</span>, there are numerous smaller roads (<span class="italic" lang="fr">routes
départementales</span>) which are practicable for all arms and transport. In
places the gradients are steep where the roads cross the deep beds of
the rivers.</p>

<p>The march of the Army on the morning of the 6th was ordered in a
direction bearing generally about east-north-east, and I did not then
expect to reach the <span lang="fr">Grand Morin</span> River the same evening, as heavy
fighting was most probable.</p>

<p>I joined Haig about 9.30 a.m. He was then engaged all along his front
against detachments of the enemy, which appeared to be advanced guards
with some supporting cavalry. The fighting had commenced about 7.30
a.m. by a move of hostile infantry on <span lang="fr">Rozoy</span>. They were attacked and
thrown back by the 4th Guards Brigade.</p>

<p>Although <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> the German artillery was in action early in the day,
close observation, combined with constant reports, showed us before
noon that this advance was not being pushed with much vigour, and
later (the right of the 1st Division being thrust forward towards
<span lang="fr">Vaudoy</span>, the left of the 2nd Division at <span lang="fr">Ormeaux</span>), as we attempted to
close with them, it was discovered that a general retreat was in
progress, covered by rearguards.</p>

<p>A visit which I paid to the 2nd Corps on Haig's left confirmed this
impression.</p>

<p>On this I gave orders that the enemy was to be closely pressed, and
that, if possible, the line of the <span lang="fr">Grand Morin</span> River was to be made
good before night.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this was not done till the next day, but a
considerable further advance was made. Our cavalry from <span lang="fr">Gastins</span> drove
the enemy back north of <span lang="fr">Dagny</span>.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 7th, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade was acting as
left flank guard to the Cavalry Division, with the 9th Lancers as
advanced guard to the Brigade.</p>

<p>On reaching <span lang="fr">Frétoy</span>, the village of <span lang="fr">Moncel</span> was found to be occupied by
a patrol of Germans, and was taken at a gallop by the leading troop,
followed by the one remaining machine gun of the regiment. About a
troop and a half, accompanied by the Commanding Officer,
Lieutenant-Colonel D. Campbell and Major Beale-Browne, moved up on the
left of the village. Shortly afterwards two squadrons of the 1st Garde
Dragoner charged the village and drove out the troop of the 9th
Lancers after a little street fighting. A third Dragoner squadron then
came up to the village from the north in support. The troop and a half
of the 9th Lancers, led by the Commanding Officer and 2nd in Command,
attacked this squadron in perfect order, charged <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> the left
half of the German squadron and pierced it with loss, both sides
facing the charge; the Germans at a 15-mile rate and the 9th Lancers
at speed.</p>

<p>Swinging round after the charge, the 9th Lancers gained the village
and rallied on the south of it. At the same time, the 18th Hussars,
who had been sent up in support, drove off the Germans by fire from
the wood on the left of the village. In this charge by the 9th Lancers
Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell was wounded in the arm by a lance and in
the leg by a bullet, both wounds, however, being slight. The adjutant,
Captain G. F. Reynolds, was severely wounded in the shoulder by a
lance. Lieutenant Alfrey, the machine-gun officer, who must have gone
to his assistance from the village, was killed whilst extracting the
lance from Captain Reynolds. Our casualties were slight&mdash;one officer
(Lieutenant Alfrey) killed, two men killed; two officers
(Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell and Captain Reynolds) wounded and five
men wounded. The number of Germans left on the ground was
considerable.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, "I" Battery, <abbr title="Royal Horse Artillery">R.H.A.</abbr>, was moved to the north of the
village, and the 18th Hussars were sent to <span lang="fr">Faujus</span> and to a line of
trees to the south of that village.</p>

<p>"B" Squadron, 18th Hussars, under Major Leveson, took up a position by
this line of trees, dismounting in the corn stooks, and was
immediately charged by a German squadron in perfect order, in line at
close order. The 18th Hussars squadron met the charge with
well-directed fire at close range, and the German squadron was almost
annihilated. A few passed through the firing line and were shot by the
horse holders. Thirty-two dead and wounded Germans were counted on the
ground in front of the squadron, and of the 60 or 70 which charged not
more than <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> a dozen escaped. A second charge was attempted
shortly afterwards, but did not approach closer than 400 yards.</p>

<p>Aircraft at night reported the German 2nd Corps (which had been moving
north nearly all day) to have entered a large forest from which we
supposed them to be debouching through Lizy north of the wood.</p>

<p>The 3rd Corps were practically in reserve, but moved up during the day
a little on our left rear.</p>

<p>On this day I saw most of the troops and found them in excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>The 6th French Army on our left was opposed chiefly by the German 4th
Reserve Corps, which, however, was reinforced by a considerable part
of the retiring 2nd Corps. The 4th German Corps had also been directed
towards this part of the battlefield.</p>

<p>The 5th French Army on our right, after a heavy day's desperate
fighting, reached the line <span lang="fr">Courtaçon&mdash;Esternay&mdash;La
Villeneuve-les-Charleville</span>. At the close of the advance and fighting
on the 6th, I returned to <span lang="fr">Melun</span> to receive reports and ascertain the
general situation of the Allied Forces. It was perfectly clear now
that the enemy had abandoned the offensive and was in full retreat
towards the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>. I sent a despatch to General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, telling him of
our work during the day and the points we had reached, and requested
instructions from him for the 7th.</p>

<p>Very late at night I got his reply, telling me that the 5th Army had
made good progress, which had been materially helped by the pressure
of the British Forces east of the enemy's right flank. He asked me to
continue the move to-morrow, but in a rather more northerly direction.</p>

<p>During the night of the 6th-7th it became necessary to study the
situation with great care. <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s original plan <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span>
presupposed a continued German advance to the south and south-east,
culminating in a great attack on the 5th and 9th French Armies. His
directions to me on the 5th were to move <span class="italic">east</span>, and attack this
advance in flank.</p>

<p>It was to attain that object that the moves of the 6th were ordered,
and, as a matter of fact, the 1st Corps under Haig did move almost due
east. The troops which opposed him were on that day supposed to be the
flank guard of the enemy which was attacking the 5th French Army.</p>

<p>As stated above, I spent some time in the morning of the 6th with the
1st Corps, but it was not before noon that the possibility of a German
retirement began to take shape in my mind. The conviction that such a
retirement was actually taking place was increased as the day wore on
and after my visits to the 2nd and 3rd Corps.</p>

<p>It was on my return to <span lang="fr">Melun</span> late in the evening of this day that Air
and Intelligence Reports, combined with the impression which my own
observations had made upon me, left no doubt in my mind that the
German retreat had really been in full progress for many hours, and
that the British Army must be immediately moved in a direction which
would bring it in close contact with the enemy.</p>

<p>Orders were therefore issued directing the march on the Grand Morin
River, which was to be forced and passed with all possible speed on
the 7th.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s request to me to move in a rather more northerly direction
pointed to some such conclusion; but I do not think that his
information during the day had impressed him to the same extent with
the drastic change in the situation, and the fact that the Germans had
so soon taken the alarm and been overtaken by a veritable "panic."</p>

<p>My intention to close at all speed with the enemy had to be tempered
by consideration for the French Armies on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> my flank, both of
which were opposed by much larger forces.</p>

<p>It was necessary to keep close touch with <span lang="fr">Franchet d'Esperey</span> on my
right, and to direct the movements of the 3rd Corps on my left so as
to bring the best possible support to the hard-pressed right of the
6th Army, who were fighting there so gallantly and well.</p>

<p>The cavalry acted with great vigour in advance of the Army throughout
the 7th, and on that day the Grand Morin River was forced and
positions were taken up well to the north-east of it.</p>

<p>The 5th and 6th French Armies were both heavily engaged throughout the
7th. The left of the 5th Army on my right reached <span lang="fr">La Ferté&mdash;Gaucher</span> at
nightfall.</p>

<p>The position of the British Army at daybreak on the 8th was,
roughly:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="italic">3rd Corps</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr">La Haute Maison</span>.</li>
<li><span class="italic">2nd Corps</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr">Aulnoy</span> and neighbourhood.</li>
<li><span class="italic">1st Corps</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr">Chailly</span> and <span lang="fr">Jouy-sur-Morin</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem before me on the night of the 7th-8th may be stated
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>I knew that the 5th Army on my right had been heavily opposed on the
7th, and that powerful forces of the enemy were still in front of it.
The 6th Army was fighting hard west of the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>, opposed to nearly
all the German 1st Army. I gathered at this time that the enemy forces
opposing our own immediate advance consisted chiefly of cavalry with a
strong artillery supporting, backed up by some infantry detachments.</p>

<p>I have referred before in this book to a visit I paid to Germany in
1911. On that occasion I saw a great deal of German cavalry in
man&oelig;uvre, and the knowledge I thus acquired <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> enabled me to
estimate the value of the forces which were now opposing me.</p>

<p>For years the German cavalry have been trained in rearguard action
such as the work they were now doing. They carry a large quantity of
machine guns, which they are trained to handle very efficiently. To
each brigade of cavalry there is attached a regiment of <span lang="de">jäger</span>, picked
riflemen, chosen for their skill in shooting and in taking advantage
of ground. These troops are specially valuable for the defence of
river lines and positions which are intended to cause delay to an
advancing enemy.</p>

<p>There was little doubt in my mind that the <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span> and <span lang="fr">Grand Morin</span>
rivers could be forced with comparative ease, but I knew that good
troops would be required, and the chief question to be considered at
that moment was how the hardly-pressed 6th French Army could best be
assisted whilst effective connection with the 5th French Army on the
right was safeguarded.</p>

<p>There was the certainty that the passages of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> opposite my
left flank, between <span lang="fr">Changis</span> and <span lang="fr">La Ferté-sous-Jouarre</span>, would be
strongly guarded, and that our advance at this point would be very
difficult. A large force of German heavy artillery was reported to be
in the loop of the river near <span lang="fr">Varreddes</span>.</p>

<p>After considering alternatives of action, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the possibility of
sending round direct help to <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span>, or the advisability of
strengthening my left flank to ensure a quicker passage there, I
decided that the best help I could bring to the 6th Army was to effect
a speedy passage of the <span lang="fr">Grand Morin</span>, <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span>, and <span lang="fr">Marne</span> rivers.</p>

<p>The course of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> at the point to be passed from left to right
was generally north-east, and the British Army after passing would be
facing north-west, which would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> bring it almost directly upon
the line of retreat of the 1st German Army, which was in close contact
with <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> across the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>. The adoption of any other method of
action which I had considered must have meant delay and a weakening of
my front. What was wanted was a speedy decision of the critical
situation on the left.</p>

<p>I had also to remember the necessity of keeping up close connection
with <span lang="fr">d'Esperey</span> on my right. Orders were accordingly issued for a
general attack on the <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span> River, to begin early on the 8th.</p>

<p>On that morning I found Haig at <span lang="fr">La Trétoire</span> (north of <span lang="fr">Rebais</span>), near
where the 4th Guards Brigade of the 2nd Division (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadier
Guards, 2nd and 3rd <abbr title="battalions">Batts.</abbr> Coldstream Guards, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Irish Guards),
supported by some field batteries, were forcing the passage of the
<span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span>.</p>

<p>I can well recall the scene. We were on some high ground which was
intersected by rocky ravines and sandhills. Just below where we stood
was the village, into which the enemy were putting a good many shells,
and beyond it lay the line of the <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span> stream with its wooded,
shelving banks, upon which the enemy was holding a strong rearguard
position on the further bank.</p>

<p>The 5th Brigade was brought up in support of the 4th, and the heavy
artillery were got into action. The crossing of the river at this
point was stoutly opposed for a considerable time; but the passage of
it, when secured, was much assisted by the cavalry and the 1st
Division, which had effected a crossing some way higher up.</p>

<p>The detailed story of this great fight is worth the telling.
Approaching the river on a fairly wide front, on the right of the 1st
Corps was the 1st Guards Brigade with a troop of the 15th Hussars,
some Cyclists, the 23rd Field <abbr title="company">Co.</abbr>, <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> and the 26th
Brigade, <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr>, which, under General Maxse, formed the advance guard
to the 1st Division in its advance from <span lang="fr">Jouy-sur-Morin</span> to <span lang="fr">Bassevelle</span>.
A French Cavalry Division was operating on our right and front,
covered by our Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>At 9.15 a.m. a French cavalry officer reported to Maxse that French
cavalry was in occupation of the heights to the north of <span lang="fr">Bellot</span>. At
9.30 a.m. the 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Black Watch and one battery of the 26th
Brigade, <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr>, had reached <span lang="fr">Bellot</span> village, and the main guard was
approaching the village through a ravine, when a battery of the
enemy's horse artillery opened fire on the column from high ground
near Fontaine <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Robert. The fire was quickly silenced by French
horse artillery guns which co-operated with our 26th Brigade. The
casualties were remarkably low considering the circumstances.</p>

<p>An alarming report reached General Maxse that a brigade of French
cavalry was cooped up in <span lang="fr">Bellot</span> exposed to artillery fire, and that a
large force of German infantry was advancing southwards through the
woods to attack them. This somewhat delayed the further advance of our
troops.</p>

<p>It was 10.40 a.m. when Colonel Grant Duff advanced to seize and picket
the heights north of the valley of the <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span> and to safeguard
the advance of the column down the valley to <span lang="fr">Sablonnières</span>. This main
guard crossed the <span lang="fr">Petit Morin</span> at 11 a.m., and shortly afterwards the
advance guard was in contact with some 250 of the enemy's <span lang="de">jäger</span> of the
Guard in the thick woods north of the ravine.</p>

<p>Some close fighting ensued, during which the Black Watch and Cameron
Highlanders suffered casualties. The enemy lost some 50 killed and 50
wounded. Subsequently the advance was continued northwards on
<span lang="fr">Hondevilliers</span>, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> 1st Guards Brigade advancing on the east
and the 3rd Brigade on the west of the ravine. Advanced troops reached
<span lang="fr">Bassevelle</span>. The 43rd Howitzer Brigade and 26th Heavy Battery were
engaged in supporting the advance of the 2nd Division during the day.</p>

<p>On the left the 4th (Guards) Brigade and the 41st Brigade, <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr>,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Lushington, <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr>, formed the advanced guard
to the 2nd Division moving from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Simeon <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Rebais</span> and <span lang="fr">La
Trétoire</span>.</p>

<p>When the vanguard of the 3rd Coldstream Guards had just passed <span lang="fr">La
Trétoire</span>, shell fire was opened on them from the high ground round
<span lang="fr">Boitron</span>.</p>

<p>The enemy's guns did not remain long in action; but the crossing was
held by the enemy, who had a machine-gun battery. The valley is
closely wooded, and the machine guns were so well placed that,
whenever our infantry came into action, they were met by a heavy fire
from these guns. The other battalions were brought up one by one to
support the 3rd Coldstream Guards; two guns were placed at the bend in
the road just north of <span lang="fr">La Trétoire</span>, and howitzers were also brought up
north of that village.</p>

<p>At 12 noon the Worcestershire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr> was sent to assist the 4th
(Guards) Brigade, and moved <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">La Trétoire&mdash;Launoy</span>&mdash;<abbr title="north">N.</abbr> of
<span lang="fr">Ruine&mdash;Moulin Neuf</span>, to force the passage of the river at <span lang="fr">Le Gravier</span>,
and to work up stream to assist the Guards Brigade.</p>

<p>By 1.30 p.m. the bridge had been seized by the Worcestershire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>,
who captured about 30 prisoners in the farm by the bridge. The 2nd
Grenadier Guards also managed to cross at La Forge.</p>

<p>The enemy retired, leaving a good many dead and two machine guns in
our hands.</p>

<p>An <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> advance was then made to the north of <span lang="fr">Boitron</span> church,
where the Divisional Artillery came into action.</p>

<p>The Connaught Rangers were despatched to work down the right bank to
assist the passage of the 3rd Division. They encountered some
opposition at <span lang="fr">Le Moulin du Pont</span>, but pushed on to near Orly, where
they found the 3rd Division already across the river.</p>

<p>At 2.30 p.m. the Grenadiers and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Coldstream Guards were sent
northwards to protect the front, whilst the Highland Light Infantry
were sent towards <span lang="fr">Bussières</span> to endeavour to cut off the enemy's
retreat.</p>

<p>The remainder of the 5th Infantry Brigade were engaged with small
bodies of the enemy in the woods north-east of the <span lang="fr">Bécherelle&mdash;Maison
Neuve</span> road, but the Brigadier-General withdrew his three battalions,
fearing they would fire on the 4th Brigade and Highland Light
Infantry, and they reached <span lang="fr">Boitron</span> about 5 p.m., except one company of
the Connaught Rangers, which worked through the woods and emerged at
<span lang="fr">Le Cas Rouge</span>, and claimed to have headed off some German stragglers.
Meanwhile, at about 4.30 p.m. the enemy made a counter-attack with
machine guns against our gun position from the woods north-west of
<span lang="fr">Boitron</span> church. This was dealt with by the Guards Brigade. The 3rd
Coldstream Guards and Irish Guards made a direct attack, whilst the
2nd Coldstream Guards swung round against the enemy. The whole
machine-gun battery of five guns surrendered with 100 personnel.</p>

<p>I then went to Smith-Dorrien, whose Headquarters were at <span lang="fr">Doué</span>. His
corps had then forced the passage of the river, but had encountered
severe opposition in doing so.</p>

<p>I found the 3rd Corps on the left advancing well at all points,
driving the enemy before them and inflicting considerable loss
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> all along the line. Pulteney was in touch with the 8th French
Division on his left; and Gough, with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade (4th
Hussars, 5th Lancers, and 16th Lancers), was successfully engaged all
the morning on the left flank. There appeared to be a considerable
force of the enemy in the woods lying to the south of Lizy, north of
the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and later reports stated that some 90 German guns were
deployed there against the right flank of the 6th French Army.</p>

<p>I impressed on Pulteney the necessity for pushing on to the utmost of
his ability in aid of the 6th Army. It looked as if he would have
considerable opposition at <span lang="fr">Changis</span> and <span lang="fr">La Ferté-sous-Jouarre</span>. The
Germans retiring over the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> at the latter place occupied the town
in strength and blew up the bridge.</p>

<p>Although the 3rd Corps were not able to pass the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> till daybreak
on the 10th, there could be no doubt that the vigour of Pulteney's
attack took considerable pressure off the right of the 6th French
Army. The British troops fought all along the line with splendid
spirit, energy, and determination, and they were skilfully handled and
led.</p>

<p>From what I could observe, however, it seemed to me that the infantry
were not in a wide enough formation, and perhaps in some cases the
field artillery were not pushed far enough forward. I called attention
to these points in the following Memorandum, which was issued on the
10th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The latest experiences have shown that the enemy never neglects an
opportunity to use all his available artillery in forward positions
under cover of cavalry and other mobile troops.</p>

<p>"Our cavalry is now organised in two Divisions, the first of three,
the second of two Brigades, each with a Brigade <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> of Horse
Artillery. During the present phase of the operations&mdash;which consist
of as rapid a pursuit and pressure of the enemy as possible in his
retreat&mdash;two Corps will generally be in first line. A Cavalry Division
will be directed to work on the front and flank of either Corps and
well in advance. The Commander of the cavalry will remain in the
closest concert with the Corps Commanders on the flank on which he is
working.</p>

<p>"The Corps Commanders will send forward with the cavalry as much of
their field artillery as can be usefully employed in harassing the
enemy's retirement. They will place them under the direction of the
Cavalry Commander for the day, the latter officer being responsible
for their safety.</p>

<p>"When, owing to the approach of darkness, the field artillery can no
longer find useful targets, they will be withdrawn from the cavalry
back to the Division to which they belong. Should the enemy make any
decided stand during such operations and a general action arise or
become imminent, the field artillery in the front will either fall
back or retain their position, at the discretion of the Corps
Commander, and again come under their Divisional Commander.</p>

<p>"The withdrawal from under the supervision of the Cavalry Commander
will always remain at the discretion of the Corps Commander.</p>

<p>"I wish to call the attention of Corps Commanders to the necessity of
warning their infantry against what is known as 'bunching up.' Losses
and delay in overcoming rearguards resistance during the present phase
of the operations have undoubtedly been caused by this.</p>

<p>"Instances have also occurred when undue delay in effecting the
passage of a river has been caused by a failure to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> realise
the nature of the problem from the purely local standpoint.</p>

<p>"Small flanking parties, crossing at unguarded points by hastily
improvised means, will dislodge hostile infantry and Maxims much more
quickly and effectively than by frontal attacks, however powerfully
supported by artillery."</p>

<p>On the night of the 9th and 10th, the 3rd Corps occupied <span lang="fr">La
Ferté-sous-Jouarre</span> and the left bank of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, but were unable to
cross, and our left ran roughly eastward through <span lang="fr">Bussières</span> and <span lang="fr">Boitron</span>
to <span lang="fr">Hondevilliers</span>.</p>

<p>In all the villages which the enemy had so hastily occupied and
evacuated, there was evidence of violent damage and looting.</p>

<p>At <span lang="fr">La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, Doué</span>, and <span lang="fr">Rebais</span>, there were signs of great
disorder and lack of discipline.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 9th the advance on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> was continued. My
Headquarters were now at <span lang="fr">Coulommiers</span>, where a number of Air reports
were received early in the day. They seemed to show that the powerful
German battery of 90 guns which had been located on the previous day
in Lizy had been withdrawn, and that the enemy in front of the 5th
French Army was somewhat reduced. The front of the 5th French Army was
apparently clear up to the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>.</p>

<p>A considerable concentration of Germans was said to be between
<span lang="fr">Chateau-Thiérry</span> and <span lang="fr">Marigny</span>, but as the large columns in the rear were
seen to be marching north, this looked only like a strong rearguard.</p>

<p>The following orders were issued to the troops at 7-30 p.m. on the
8th:&mdash;</p>

<p>Allenby, with the cavalry, seized the bridges at <span lang="fr">Charly-sur-Marne</span> and
<span lang="fr">Saulchéry</span> and, advancing rapidly to the high ground north about
<span lang="fr">Fontaine Fauvel</span>, covered the rapid passage of the 1st Corps over these
bridges. Clearing the ground of the enemy and making many captures,
the 1st Army Corps reached <span lang="fr">Domptin</span>, and the cavalry the heights about
<span lang="fr">Montgivrault</span>, some miles further north.</p>

<p>The 3rd Division of the 2nd Corps, to the left, seized and crossed the
bridge at <span lang="fr">Nanteuil</span> early in the day. The 5th Division (2nd Corps)
crossed at <span lang="fr">Méry</span>, but was then held up for some time by German
artillery said to be in the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">La Sablonnière</span>. It was
essential to my general plan that the 2nd Corps should not get too far
north until the 1st and 3rd Corps were completely established on the
further bank of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>. Smith-Dorrien was instructed accordingly.</p>

<p>As the fight progressed during the day, our 3rd Corps at <span lang="fr">La
Ferté-sous-Jouarre</span> and the 8th French Division at <span lang="fr">Changis</span> found
difficulty in crossing the river. I then instructed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span>
Smith-Dorrien to send one Division towards Dhuisy to menace the rear
of the troops opposing these crossings. The 5th Division was directed
there, but as they were unable to overcome the enemy's resistance they
only succeeded in reaching <span lang="fr">Montreuil</span>, 2 miles <abbr title="south-east">S.E.</abbr> of Dhuisy, very
late at night.</p>

<p>I found Pulteney south of <span lang="fr">La Ferté</span> early in the morning, and heavy
fighting going on to gain the passage of the river which the enemy was
still vigorously disputing. It was a remarkable scene. The banks of
the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> at this point are somewhat steep, and there is high
commanding ground on either side of the river. The old town of <span lang="fr">La
Ferté</span>, so famous in Napoleon's campaign of 1814, presented a
picturesque appearance with its ancient church and buildings.
Surrounded and held by the enemy, it seemed to frown down on the
broken bridge, forbidding all approach. The enemy was vigorously
defending the passage, strongly supported by artillery from the high
ground north of the town.</p>

<p>The 4th Division in two columns attempted to advance on the bridge
with a view to repairing it and then to close and establish a
bridgehead on the northern bank, but all their attempts were
frustrated by the German guns. Just after dark, however, Hunter
Weston's 11th Brigade (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Somersetshire Light Infantry, 1st
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> East Lancashire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Hampshire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Rifle Brigade) was able to reach the southern bank, where a number of
boats were seized. In these the brigade was pushed across, and by 10
p.m. had established an effective footing on the northern bank, under
cover of which a pontoon bridge was constructed by the Royal Engineers
of the 4th Division under very heavy fire. It was a very fine piece of
work, to which the Commander of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> the 3rd Corps particularly
drew my attention. During this operation Colonel <span lang="fr">Le Marchant</span> was
killed.</p>

<p>Another detachment also effected a crossing further up the river in
the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Chamigny</span>, but the main body of the 3rd Corps
crossed by the pontoon bridge in the early hours of the 10th.</p>

<p>I found Smith-Dorrien at Pulteney's Headquarters.</p>

<p>The 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades were operating between the 3rd and
2nd Corps, filling up the gap, which, however, in view of the enemy's
hurried retirement, never caused me any apprehension.</p>

<p>It has been stated that on the 8th I called upon General <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> for
assistance in forcing the river, and that this was the reason why the
French 8th Division was not taken away.</p>

<p>I can only say that no such request was ever made by me or my
Headquarters Staff, nor had any other commander my sanction for such a
demand. I felt throughout the battle that my principal <span class="italic">rôle</span> was to
bring assistance in the best manner and in the most effective
direction to the 6th Army, for I fully appreciated the much greater
difficulty of the task which they were undertaking. On the other hand
my diary shows that on the 9th I received two urgent messages from
<span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> begging me to take the pressure of the enemy's 3rd Corps off
him, and I think the action of the British Army on the 9th had this
effect.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I rode across the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> at <span lang="fr">Nogent</span> and met several
units of the 1st Army Corps moving up the heights of the north side of
the river. I was tremendously struck by their general appearance and
attitude. They were full of spirit and fired with enthusiasm. They had
upon them that war-worn look which we all know so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> well, but
one felt, as one rode beside them, that here were troops whom nothing
could stop, who asked only to be led forward, and who were enveloped
in an atmosphere of confidence and victory.</p>

<p>They were very tired, however; how tired was not brought fully home to
me until I came to the 5th Cavalry Brigade (the Scots Greys, 12th
Lancers, and 20th Hussars).</p>

<p>The whole brigade was dismounted behind some woods on the heights.
Every man of them, except a small proportion of horse holders, was
lying fast asleep on the ground.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the Brigadier (Chetwode), I rode into the midst of the
sleeping mass, my horse picking his way through the recumbent figures.
They hardly stirred.</p>

<p>I was anxious to say a few words to the men, and the Brigadier asked
me if he should call them up to attention. I said, "No, let them
rest," adding that I would talk to them for anyone to hear who
happened to be awake and not too done up to listen. I thanked them, as
they lay there on the ground, for all they had done; I told them of
the situation and of our hopes of complete victory. A few men tried to
struggle up; others, half awake, leaned on their elbows and drowsily
listened. I hardly realised that they had heard anything of what I had
said. This particular regiment was the Scots Greys, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Bulkeley Johnson, who afterwards fell so gallantly
at the head of his brigade on the <span lang="fr">Ancre</span>. Bulkeley Johnson subsequently
told me that every word I had spoken on that occasion was published
afterwards in the local papers all over Scotland. From the Greys I
went on to the other two regiments of the brigade and the horse
batteries, where I witnessed similar scenes.</p>

<p>On my return to Headquarters I received the welcome news <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span>
that the 5th French Army on my right was across the river and in close
touch with the British; and that the 6th French Army, after desperate
fighting, had practically got possession of the lower bridges of the
<span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>, to which river the enemy was only clinging on his northern
flank in order, apparently, to cover his retreat. In short, since noon
the Germans had given up resistance and were now, at nightfall, in
full retreat.</p>

<p>During this day we made large captures in prisoners and war material,
and our position at night was (roughly) along the line <span lang="fr">La
Ferté&mdash;Bezu&mdash;Domptin</span>, with the cavalry well forward.</p>

<p>In my dispatches of September 17th, 1914, I estimated that the Battle
of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> reached its conclusion on the night of September 10th,
and I see no reason to think otherwise now.</p>

<p>On that night the British forces reached the line <span lang="fr">La
Ferté&mdash;Milon&mdash;Neuilly&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Front&mdash;Rocourt</span>.</p>

<p>The 6th French Army had been wheeling up their right into line with
us, and the 5th French Army was nearly in line on our right. The enemy
were in full retreat to the north and north-east. During the day, the
cavalry, the 1st Army Corps, and the 2nd Army Corps had fought
numerous engagements with the enemy's rearguard, and had made large
captures. Allenby, as usual, had handled his cavalry with great vigour
and skill, nor had his detachments of the 3rd and 5th Brigades on the
left under General Gough been less energetic. The bridging of the
<span lang="fr">Marne</span> at <span lang="fr">La Ferté-sous-Jouarre</span> by engineers of the 3rd Corps was a
fine piece of work. Our casualties were heavy, but, having regard to
the results attained, by no means excessive.</p>

<p>I was able to visit some of the hospital trains on the 10th. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span>
Although there had been no chance yet of fully developing the
organisation of the wounded transport service, I think the best was
done with the means available at the moment.</p>

<p>Much has been written to recount the story of this great battle, and,
doubtless for the next century, controversy will rage over the event
and its results.</p>

<p>At the opening of the battle, on the morning of September 6th, the
Allied forces had to turn from the task of arranging defensive
positions on the <span lang="fr">Seine</span>. The 5th French Army and the British Army had
already fallen back close to that river in accordance with the general
plan, and the rear echelons of transport, etc. rested to the south of
it.</p>

<p>Between September 6th and 12th the German Army was driven back
pell-mell from the <span lang="fr">Seine</span> to the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, a distance of 65 miles, whilst
the front extended from Paris to <span lang="fr">Verdun</span>. Their losses in officers,
men, prisoners, guns, machine guns, and war material were enormous.
Most desperate battles were fought all along the line.</p>

<p>Many different views have been put forward regarding the initial
foundation upon which the Germans built up their strategic scheme for
the invasion of France. It is not my purpose here to discuss them or
to speculate upon what was actually in the minds of the Great General
Staff when they set out upon this gigantic enterprise. Whatever the
original conception may have been, I claim for the Allies that its
fulfilment was crushed for ever and a day at the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>.</p>

<p>Splendidly, however, as the Allied Armies fought, skilfully as each of
the various corps and armies which were engaged supported one another;
it was the Germans themselves who deliberately threw away whatever
chance they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> ever had of securing a decisive victory. We have
seen that so late as the morning of September 6th, <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and I were
still so certain that the German thrust was in full career that an
advance by the British Army in an almost easterly direction was
ordered and partially undertaken.</p>

<p>Yet at that time von Kluck's great "advance" had for some hours become
a counter-march in hurried "retreat."</p>

<p>Why this sudden change?</p>

<p>Because he then discovered that his communications were about to be
threatened on the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>. Surely the most inexperienced of generals
might have anticipated some such threat, and, further, might have
realised that the line of the River <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span> afforded him the most
convenient and efficient means of securing flank protection. It has
been said by critics of the battle that, had <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> delayed his
movement on the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>, von Kluck would not have taken alarm. But when
the German General first ordered the counter-march the French General
had hardly recrossed the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>.</p>

<p>The fact probably is that von Kluck and his Staff never really liked
the <span class="italic">rôle</span> which was forced upon them by the Great General Staff, and
that they undertook their part in the battle with wavering minds and
with their heads half turned round.</p>

<p>When the Allied Armies look back to this great battle and realise what
was accomplished, they cannot fail to remember with a thrill of pride
that they fought and badly defeated an army not only flushed with the
knowledge that it had effected a tremendous inroad into the enemy's
territory, but which also enjoyed one other incalculable advantage; it
was commanded and led by a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> Sovereign who possessed absolute
authority&mdash;military and civil. Its Emperor and Commander-in-Chief was
served by a Great General Staff which had been steadily and vigorously
preparing for this tremendous trial of strength for a period of over
forty years.</p>

<p>This great collision of nations in arms had been kept steadfastly in
view. In the preparation of the German Army for this supreme moment
not a chance had been thrown away. In man power, armament, training,
and equipment; in the instruction of leaders and officers; on the
choice of commanders and every other element which makes for
efficiency in an army, the most laborious thought and care had been
expended.</p>

<p>Compare with this the conditions in which the French and British
Armies had been brought up to this fateful hour&mdash;systems, staffs,
military policy, even money grants, all undergoing constant and
drastic change year after year with every fresh wave of popular
opinion and every fresh clamour, whilst the intrigues which run riot
in all branches of the public service when "votes" rule everything,
exercised their usual baneful influence.</p>

<p>As regards the tactical aspect of the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, I believe
that the name of Marshal <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> will descend to posterity with that
battle as one of the greatest military commanders in history; I
believe that the battles fought and won throughout the great length of
the line over which they took place by the Armies of France under
their splendid leaders, will outshine for valour and skill even those
glorious deeds of the past, the memorials of which deck their colours
with imperishable laurels.</p>

<p>For the British Army I claim that we carried out the <span class="italic">rôle</span> assigned
to us, and that our rapid passages of the various <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> river
lines in face of great opposition, and our unexpected appearance on
the lines of retreat of the forces opposing the 5th and 6th Armies,
were practically decisive of the great result.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF THE <span lang="fr">AISNE</span> AND ITS PROGRESS UP TO SEPTEMBER 30TH</h4>

<p>I am throwing my thoughts back, and endeavouring to recall the mental
atmosphere which surrounded me during the two days of pursuit
following the fighting on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, and during the early days of the
Battle of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, which I am now about to recount.</p>

<p>I know that the predominant sentiments which ruled my mind were
decidedly optimistic.</p>

<p>As I pointed out in the opening pages of this book, we had not <span class="italic">even
then</span> grasped the true effect and bearing of the many new elements
which had entered into the practice of modern war. We fully believed
we were driving the Germans back to the <span lang="fr">Meuse</span> if not to the Rhine, and
all my correspondence and communications at this time with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and
the French Generals most closely associated with me, breathed the same
spirit.</p>

<p>This will be better understood if I quote an order which was issued
from French General Headquarters, at <span lang="fr">Chatillon</span>, dated September 10th,
the day which practically saw the close of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> battle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The German forces are giving way on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> and in Champagne before
the Allied Armies of the centre and left wing.</p>

<p>"To confirm and take advantage of this success, it is necessary to
follow up this movement with energy so as to allow the enemy no rest.</p>


<p>"The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> offensive movement will, therefore, be continued along
the whole front in a general <abbr title="north-north-east">N.N.E.</abbr> direction.</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>"(<span class="italic">a</span>) The 6th Army will continue to rest its right on the <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>
     at the <span lang="fr">Sapières</span> stream and on to the line
     <span lang="fr">Longpont&mdash;Chaudun&mdash;Courmelles&mdash;Soissons</span> (inclusive). <span lang="fr">Bridoux</span>'s
     Cavalry Corps will gain ground on the outer wing and will
     endeavour to disturb the enemy's line of communication and
     retreat.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">b</span>) The British forces should follow up their victorious
     advance between the above-mentioned line and the road
     <span lang="fr">Rocourt&mdash;Fère-en-Tardenois&mdash;Mont Notre Dame&mdash;Bazoches</span>, which will
     be at their disposal.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">c</span>) The 5th Army east of the latter line will turn the forest
     <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> and <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> of <span lang="fr">Epernay</span> on the west, covering itself against hostile
     troops which may be found there, and ready to act in an easterly
     direction towards Rheims against the columns which are retiring
     before 9th Army. The 10th Corps will move from about <span lang="fr">Vertus</span> in
     the direction of <span lang="fr">Epernay&mdash;Rheims</span>, securing connection between the
     5th and 9th Armies and ready to support the latter at any time."</p>
</div>

<p>Subsequent to the issue of the above orders, <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and I held several
consultations with reference to marches through the wooded country
(<span lang="fr">Forêt de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gobain</span> and other places) lying to the north of the
<span lang="fr">Aisne</span>.</p>

<p>In these first few days of this period of the war we were decidedly
encouraged by reports from other theatres. The Belgian Army appeared
to be well established in Antwerp, and a fine sortie, directed by the
King of the Belgians, had considerable effect in scattering the German
forces <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> operating there, and certainly delayed the movement
of reinforcements which had been ordered south.</p>

<p>The news from Russia was also not unfavourable.</p>

<p>However, we were destined to undergo another terrible disappointment.
The lessons of war as it is to-day had to be rubbed in by another
dearly bought experience, and in a hard and bitter school.</p>

<p>The first surprise came when the "Jack Johnsons" began to fall. This
was a nickname given by the men ("Black Marias" was another) to a
high-explosive shell fired from 8-in. howitzers, which had been
brought down from the fortress of <span lang="fr">Maubeuge</span> to support the German
defensive position on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>. They were our first experience of an
artillery much heavier than our own. Although these guns caused
considerable damage and many bad casualties, they never had any very
demoralising effect upon the troops.</p>

<p>As day by day the trench fighting developed and I came to realise more
and more the much greater relative power which modern weapons have
given to the defence; as new methods were adopted in the defensive use
of machine guns; and as unfamiliar weapons in the shape of "trench
mortars" and "bombs," hand grenades, etc. began to appear on the
battlefield, so, day by day, I began dimly to apprehend what the
future might have in store for us.</p>

<p>This drastic process of education went steadily on, but still reports
came periodically from our aircraft, from our trenches, and from the
French on either flank, that the enemy in front of us was "weakening,"
that (phantom!) columns had been seen marching north, etc.&mdash;and so the
small still voice of truth and reality, trying to speak within me,
remained faint and almost unheard.</p>

<p>Presently <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> came <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span>'s great effort to turn the German
right flank. I witnessed one day of this fighting myself with General
<span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> and came back hopeful: alas! these hopes were not fulfilled.
Afterwards we witnessed the stupendous efforts of <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span> and
Foch, but all ended in the same trench! trench! trench!</p>

<p>I finished my part in the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, however, unconverted,
and it required the further and more bitter lesson of my own failure
in the north to pass the Lys River, during the last days of October,
to bring home to my mind a principle in warfare of to-day which I have
held ever since, namely, that given forces fairly equally matched, you
can "bend" but you cannot "break" your enemy's trench line.</p>

<p>Everything which has happened in the war has borne out the truth of
this view, and from the moment I grasped this great truth I never
failed to proclaim it, although eventually I suffered heavily for
holding such opinions.</p>

<p>The great feature of the pursuit on the 11th was the capture by the
3rd French Army of all the artillery of a German corps.</p>

<p>On the 12th my Headquarters were moved to <span lang="fr">Fère-en-Tardenois</span>. Early in
the day I joined Pulteney at some cross-roads two miles south of
<span lang="fr">Buzancy</span> (<abbr title="south-east">S.E.</abbr> of <span lang="fr">Soissons</span>). The enemy was opposing the passage of the
<span lang="fr">Aisne</span> to the 6th French Army all along its line westwards from
<span lang="fr">Soissons</span>, and the 4th Division held a position on the bridges
south-east of <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> to assist it.</p>

<p>The banks of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> are very precipitous, and our position on the
heights gave us a wonderful view of the fighting. What astonished me
was the volume of the fire. Between <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> and <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> the river
seemed ablaze, so intense was the artillery fire on both sides.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> watched the action till about 1.30 p.m., when the German
artillery, which had been very active all the morning at <span lang="fr">Montagne</span> de
Paris (south of <span lang="fr">Soissons</span>) and other important points, withdrew north
of the river. We saw large masses of transport and troops moving in a
<abbr title="north-east">N.E.</abbr> direction.</p>

<p>At nightfall our 3rd Corps was close to the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, the bridges of
which were destroyed.</p>

<p>On my return to Headquarters at night the reporting officer informed
me that the 6th French Army had reached the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> after some
opposition, and that the French cavalry on the left were working round
by <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> and moving <abbr title="north-east">N.E.</abbr> to threaten the German communications.</p>

<p>The 5th French Army on our right was on the line
<span lang="fr">Cormicy&mdash;Rheims&mdash;Verzy</span>, the 18th Corps being thrown back on its left
flank in touch with our right.</p>

<p>A message from <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> informed me that the 9th and 4th French Armies
had both made considerable progress and driven back the enemy.</p>

<p>The cavalry under Allenby did very good work on this day. They cleared
the town of <span lang="fr">Braine</span> and the high ground beyond it of strong hostile
detachments. They bivouacked this night at Dhuizel. Allenby reported
to me some excellent work done in the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Braine</span> by the
Queen's Bays assisted by Shaw's 9th Brigade of the 3rd Division (1st
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Northumberland Fusiliers, 4th <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Fusiliers, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Lincolnshire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Scots Fusiliers).</p>

<p>The 1st Corps reached <span lang="fr">Vauxcéré</span> and the 2nd Corps <span lang="fr">Braine</span> and
neighbourhood. Gough, with the 2nd Cavalry Division, was at <span lang="fr">Chermizy</span>.</p>

<p>Thus, on the morning of September 13th, the day on which the Battle of
the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> really opened, the British Army <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> was in position
south of that river in its course between <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> on the west and
<span lang="fr">Bourg</span> on the east, with outposts on the river.</p>

<p>Now as to the ground over which the British Army fought. The <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>
valley runs generally east and west, and consists of a flat-bottomed
depression, of width varying from half a mile to two miles, down which
the river follows a winding course to the west, at some points near
the southern slopes of the valley and at others near the northern. The
high ground, both on the north and south of the river, is
approximately 400 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> above the bottom of the valley itself, which is
broken into numerous rounded spurs and re-entrants. The most prominent
of the former are the <span lang="fr">Chivres</span> spur on the right bank and the <span lang="fr">Sermoise</span>
spur on the left.</p>

<p>Near the latter place the general plateau on the south is divided by a
subsidiary valley of much the same character, down which the small
river <span lang="fr">Vesle</span> flows to the main stream near <span lang="fr">Sermoise</span>. The slopes of the
plateau overlooking the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> on the north and south are of varying
steepness, and are covered with numerous patches of wood, which also
stretch upwards and backwards over the edge on to the top of the high
ground. There are several small towns and villages dotted about in the
valley itself and along its sides, the chief of which is the town of
<span lang="fr">Soissons</span>.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> is a sluggish stream of some 170 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> in breadth, but, being
15 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> deep in the centre, it is unfordable. Between <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> on the
west and <span lang="fr">Villers</span> on the east (the part of the river attacked and
secured by the British forces) there are eleven road bridges across
it. On the north bank a narrow-gauge railway runs from <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> to
<span lang="fr">Vailly</span>, where it crosses the river and continues eastward <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span>
along the south bank. From <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> to <span lang="fr">Sermoise</span> a double line of
railway runs along the south bank, turning at the latter place up the
<span lang="fr">Vesle</span> valley towards <span lang="fr">Bazoches</span>.</p>

<p>The position held by the enemy was a very strong one, either for a
delaying action or for a defensive battle. One of its chief military
characteristics is that, from the high ground, on neither side can the
top of the plateau on the other side be seen, except for small
stretches. This is chiefly due to the woods on the edges of the
slopes. Another important point is that all the bridges are under
either direct or high-angle artillery fire.</p>

<p>The general lay and contour of the ground in the region over which the
British Army fought at the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> are deeply impressed on
my memory.</p>

<p>Rolling downs of considerable altitude characterise the country over
which the approaches to the river from the south lead, whilst the
banks of the river itself, especially at the south, are wooded,
precipitate and rocky. Thus was I able to secure many posts of
observation which enabled me to compass a much greater personal survey
of the fighting than in any other terrain over which we fought.</p>

<p>During the early phases of the Battle of Ypres, the high ground north
of the River Lys presented some similar features; just as Kemmel Hill,
and the height overlooking Lens and, further south, the rolling plains
west of the Somme, were also good for observation; but these all
differed from the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> as affording a distant view, whereas, by
avoiding observation and creeping through woods and undergrowth, it
was possible to reach points of vantage on the southern bank of the
<span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, whence a close observation of the fighting line could be
maintained.</p>

<p>I can remember sitting for hours at the mouth of a great <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span>
cave which lay high up the southern bank of the river, within about
400 yards of the village of Missy and to the eastern flank of it, from
which point I saw some of the first effects of the 6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> siege
howitzers which were sent to us at that time. Missy lay along the bed
of the stream on both banks, and the Germans occupied a curiously
shaped, high, conical hill which was called "<span lang="fr">Condé</span> Fort." This was
situated about 600 yards north of Missy, and reached by a steep ascent
from the banks of the river. The hill completely dominated the
village.</p>

<p>On the day of which I am writing (September 24th), it was very
interesting to witness the clearance of this hill by our
high-explosive shells. We could see the Germans flying in all
directions to the rear, and we subsequently got reliable information
that their losses on this occasion were very heavy.</p>

<p>Although this relieved the pressure on the 5th Division, which was
holding Missy and the entrenchments to the north of it, I have always
thought it very creditable to Sir Charles Fergusson and his command
that he retained his hold on Missy to the last in face of the
threatening situation on his front.</p>

<p>He was no doubt much helped by the superior power of observation
obtained by his artillery owing to the configuration of the ground all
along the south bank, and this, in fact, was most helpful to the
British Army throughout the battle.</p>

<p>Missy is another instance in proof of the principle which all recent
fighting has clearly established, namely, that command of ground is of
value chiefly with regard to the power of observation it affords.</p>

<p>On another occasion I well remember spending a long time lying on the
top of a rick, covered by hay for concealment. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> From this
point very valuable artillery observation was secured, and an
excellent view of all Haig's positions was afforded.</p>

<p>Poor Wing, the <abbr title="Commander Royal Artillery">C.R.A.</abbr> of the 1st Corps, took me to this place, and was
beside me all the time. He was afterwards killed at the Battle of Loos
whilst in command of the 12th Division. He was beloved by all who
served with him; his gallantry, skill, and dash were spoken of by
every one, and his loss was deeply felt.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the 13th, we attacked the river line all along
our front. The enemy artillery made a vigorous defence, employing many
heavy and other kinds of guns. The German infantry was not very
energetic in defence, but the bombardment continued heavily all day on
both sides. At nightfall all passages except that at <span lang="fr">Condé</span> were
secured and held, our advance line running from <span lang="fr">Bucy-le-Long</span> on the
west through spurs <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> and <abbr title="north-east">N.E.</abbr> of <span lang="fr">Celles</span> to <span lang="fr">Bourg</span> on the east.</p>

<p>On this afternoon I went to see the bridge which the 3rd Corps had
thrown over the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> at <span lang="fr">Venizel</span>. The task had to be done under fire
of heavy guns with high-explosive shell, and it was a fine piece of
work.</p>

<p>After leaving there, I went to the Headquarters of the 5th Division at
<span lang="fr">Serches</span>, where I met Fergusson. Here I learnt that up to then they had
been unable to approach the crossing at Missy, as the enemy had
infantry and machine guns on the opposite bank, supported by artillery
in rear. Throughout the battle this particular point was a locality of
great interest.</p>

<p>Early on the 14th I got news that the 6th Division, which had been
sent out to me from England, was now concentrated south of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>,
and was beginning its march to join us.</p>

<p>During <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> the night of the 13th all three Corps had constructed
bridges on their fronts for crossing, and in the early morning of the
14th, the remainder of the 1st Corps crossed at <span lang="fr">Bourg</span>, the 2nd at
<span lang="fr">Vailly</span> and <span lang="fr">Missy</span>, and the 3rd Corps at <span lang="fr">Venizel</span>. On the 14th I spent
some time with Haig, who was very successful, and made an excellent
advance considering the strong opposition which confronted him.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Lomax, with the 1st Division, surprised the
enemy at <span lang="fr">Vendresse</span>, capturing 600 prisoners and 12 guns. This
distinguished Divisional Commander died a few months later from the
effect of wounds received during the first Battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>From the opening of the campaign up to the day he was wounded his
services were invaluable. The Division he commanded was always in the
hottest of the fighting, and he commanded it throughout with
consummate skill and dash. His personality gained for him the esteem
and affection of all who served with him, and his loss was badly felt
throughout the Army.</p>

<p>On this day (14th) the 2nd Division also made good progress, and in
the evening its left held the Ostel Spur, an important point of
vantage.</p>

<p>The centre and left of the Army were not so successful. The 3rd
Division, after crossing at <span lang="fr">Vailly</span>, had nearly reached <span lang="fr">Aizy</span> (about
2-&frac12; miles north of the river) when they were driven back by a
powerful counter-attack supported by a strong force of heavy
artillery. At nightfall, however, they were still one mile north of
the river. The enemy's artillery position north of <span lang="fr">Aizy</span> was a very
strong one.</p>

<p>The 5th Division was unable to advance beyond the northern edge of the
<span lang="fr">Chivres</span> plateau. Here also a considerable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> force of heavy
artillery was concentrated against them.</p>

<p>The 4th Division retained during the 14th the position they had taken
the day before north of <span lang="fr">Bucy-le-Long</span>.</p>

<p>The 6th French Army pushed up its left flank, and the 4th French Corps
was advancing east in support of the 7th Corps, which was holding the
enemy from the north.</p>

<p>The French position about <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> was well held all day.</p>

<p>The 18th Corps (5th French Army) had its left flank close to the right
of our 1st Corps on the heights of <span lang="fr">Craonne</span>. The remainder of the 5th
Army was heavily engaged the whole day all along its line as far as
<span lang="fr">Rheims</span>.</p>

<p>On the night of the 14th I began to think that the enemy was really
making a determined stand on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>.</p>

<p>Our situation on this night was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st Corps and Cavalry Division holding line <span lang="fr">Troyon</span>&mdash;<abbr title="south">S.</abbr> of <span lang="fr">Chivy</span>&mdash;<abbr title="south">S.</abbr> of
<span lang="fr">Beaulne&mdash;Soupir</span>, with 1st and 2nd Cavalry Brigades on the left, all in
close touch with the enemy.</p>

<p>1st Corps Headquarters: <span lang="fr">Courcelles</span> (afterwards Dhuizel).</p>

<p>2nd Corps: 3rd Division holding circle round <span lang="fr">Vailly</span>, 5th Division
holding south of <span lang="fr">Chivres</span> plateau to <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Sainte">Ste.</abbr> Marguerite</span> and Missy, both in
close touch with the enemy; guns on south bank of river.</p>

<p>3rd Corps: 4th Division holding south end of Spurs from <span lang="fr">Le Moncel</span> to
<span lang="fr">Crouy</span> (French on north of <span lang="fr">Crouy</span> ridge), also in close touch with
enemy; 19th Brigade in reserve at <span lang="fr">Venizel</span> Bridge.</p>

<p>Gough's 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades: <span lang="fr">Chassemy</span>.</p>

<p>On this day our casualties were heavy, amounting to between <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span>
1,500 and 2,000, including three Commanding Officers.</p>

<p>On the 15th my impression of the previous day, namely, that the enemy
was making a firm stand in his actual position, was confirmed also by
an intercepted German wireless message. It seemed probable that we had
the whole of the German 1st Army in front of us.</p>

<p>This being my appreciation of the situation, I was not satisfied with
my own position in two important respects. In the first place, our
losses were heavily accumulating, and I had not sufficient reserves to
reinforce dangerous points; the enemy had a great artillery
superiority, and at this time and for some days afterwards I badly
felt the want of the guns and machine guns which had been lost at <span lang="fr">Le
Cateau</span> and were not yet made good. In the second place, I was most
anxious to get the 2nd and 3rd Corps forward and more in line with the
1st Corps on the right.</p>

<p>The 6th Division had now crossed the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, moving north, and orders
were sent to its Commander, General Keir, to come up as quickly as
possible. My idea was that the 6th Division should go to Haig, and
that, with this reinforcement, he should advance west and take the
pressure off the 2nd and 3rd Corps.</p>

<p>The 1st Corps was heavily counter-attacked on several occasions
throughout the 15th, and, although the enemy was most gallantly
repulsed everywhere, our losses were very severe.</p>

<p>Towards evening a retirement of both German infantry and cavalry took
place, and my hopes were revived of the continuance of the enemy's
retreat. On this I directed the 6th Division to join its own 3rd Corps
on the left.</p>

<p>However, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> the enemy showing no further signs of leaving the
position, my hopes for a further advance at last began to be founded
altogether upon the probability of a successful attack by the 6th
French Army.</p>

<p>On the 16th I went to see General <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> at his Headquarters. I
found him watching an attack of the 61st and 62nd Divisions on the
village of <span lang="fr">Nouvron</span> and the plateau above it. The General and his Staff
were standing on a kind of grassy tableland on the edge of a wood. I
remember that a French Staff Officer who was there spoke English
fluently. I threw myself down on my face on the grass and watched the
battle taking place on the other side of the river. I spent an hour or
two with the General at this spot and discussed the situation with
him. From all I could see the French appeared to be getting on very
well.</p>

<p>On my way back I visited the Corps Commanders again, and they all
expressed the utmost confidence in their ability to hold their
positions.</p>

<p>After my return to Headquarters in the evening, Colonel C. B. Thompson
(liaison officer with the 6th French Army) reported to me. His
accounts were disappointing after my experience during the day with
<span lang="fr">Maunoury</span>. He said that the 13th French Corps had been checked
south-west of <span lang="fr">Noyon</span> by a night-attack of troops from the 9th Reserve
German Corps, which was said to have reached <span lang="fr">Noyon</span> from Belgium. Here
was another incident in that continual "flanking" and "outflanking"
man&oelig;uvre which was only to cease at the sea.</p>

<p>Again, the 4th French Corps arriving east had been arrested on finding
the German force entrenched on its left (northern) flank.</p>

<p>It is from this particular evening of 16th September that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> I
date the origin of a grave anxiety which then began to possess me.</p>

<p>In the years which preceded the war, discussions on various subjects
which had come before the Imperial Committee of Defence, of which I
was a member, had imbued my mind with a sense of the vital importance
it was to Great Britain that the Channel ports should be held by a
power in absolute friendship with us.</p>

<p>I venture here to quote some extracts from a paper which I wrote very
shortly before the war, for circulation amongst the members of the
Committee of Imperial Defence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... I think it will be allowed that, in a war between ourselves and a
great Continental Power which is in possession of the Eastern Channel
coast-line between Dunkirk and <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span>, submarines, assisted by
aircraft, would effectually deny the passage of the Straits of Dover
to any war or other vessel which was not submersible. In fact, the
command of the sea, in so far as this part of the Channel is
concerned, would not depend upon the relative strength of the opposing
Navies, but would remain in dispute until one side or other effected
practical destruction of its adversary's aircraft and submarines.</p>

<p>"The way would then lie open to the Power which had gained this
advantage to move an invading force of any size in comparative safety
across the Straits at any part of the coast between (say) Ramsgate and
Dungeness on the one side and Dunkirk and <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> on the other.</p>

<p>"The command of these Straits would be a contest between submarines
and aeroplanes....</p>

<p>"If the Continental Powers secured the command they would possess the
great advantage of menacing us with a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> twentieth century
edition of the stroke Napoleon intended to deal against us from
<span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> in 1805.</p>

<p>"To put the matter briefly; I hold that the Straits of Dover, regarded
as a military obstacle to the invasion of this country, will, in the
not far distant future, altogether lose their maritime character, and
the problem of their successful passage by an invading force will
present features somewhat resembling those involving the attack and
defence of great river lines or operations on the great lakes in a war
between Canada and the United States.</p>

<p>"The main object to be attained in trying to secure the passage of a
great river line is to gain possession of the opposite bank and
establish a strong bridgehead.</p>

<p>"In accordance with the views enunciated in this paper, I apply the
same principle to the Straits of Dover, and hold that the only
reliable defence against a powerful attack by hostile aircraft and
submarines in vastly superior numbers, is to possess a strong
bridgehead on the French coast with an effective means of passing and
repassing across the Straits which would only be secured by the
projected Channel Tunnel."</p>

<p>The bearing of all this upon the subject of the present chapter is
apparent. So long as the Germans were being driven back, whether by
frontal or flank attack, the Channel ports might be considered
comparatively safe; but on the particular night of which I am speaking
(September 16th) I had arrived at the conclusion that a frontal attack
was hopeless, whilst it began to appear that any threat against the
German flank would be effectually countered if not turned against
ourselves.</p>

<p>This, then, was my great fear. What was there to prevent the enemy
launching a powerful movement for the purpose of securing the Channel
ports, whilst the main <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> forces were engaged in practically
neutralising one another?</p>

<p>From this time I sent constant and urgent warnings to London by wire
and by letter to look out for the safety of these same ports.</p>

<p>It was just about now that I began to conceive the idea of disengaging
from the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> and moving to a position in the north, for the main
purpose of defending the Channel ports and, as a secondary reason, to
be in a better position to concert combined action and co-operation
with the Navy.</p>

<p>At the moment of which I am speaking, and for many days afterwards,
there was no serious thought or belief that Antwerp was in danger. My
fear for the Channel ports, which then began to lay a strong hold upon
my thoughts, in all probability influenced my mind, and, perhaps,
affected my dispositions throughout the rest of the time during which
I took my part in the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>.</p>

<p>I remember on the same day (September 16th) visiting some hospital
trains which were taking the wounded away. It was gratifying to mark
the great improvement in their organisation and equipment.</p>

<p>On the 17th the 1st Corps was heavily attacked, but repulsed the enemy
with great loss. <span lang="fr">Craonne</span> was lost by the 18th French Corps, but a
strong position was still maintained by them on the <span lang="fr">Chemin des Dames</span>.</p>

<p>Our operations on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> were at this time much hampered by heavy
rain.</p>

<p>On this day (September 17th) a French Reserve Division captured two
complete battalions of Prussian Guards in <span lang="fr">Berry-au-Bac</span>, and a French
Cavalry Corps made a splendid raid on the German communications,
operating <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> from <span lang="fr">Roye</span> and moving east as far as the
neighbourhood of Ham and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin. In this raid General <span lang="fr">Bridoux</span>,
commanding the Cavalry Corps, was killed in his motor, and his papers
were captured.</p>

<p>I detached the 6th Division from Pulteney's command (3rd Corps) to
form an Army Reserve, but gave him the use of the divisional
artillery.</p>

<p>An entrenched position was now selected and laid out, and work begun
on it south of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> in view of a possible retreat to the south of
the river.</p>

<p>The 1st Corps continuing to be subject to heavy and constant attacks,
I reinforced Haig on the 18th with a brigade of the 6th Division, and
moved the remainder of that Division into a more central position. My
anxiety as to reserves caused me also to move Gough's Cavalry Division
from the 2nd Corps to take up that duty.</p>

<p>The prominent feature of this day's dispositions was the issue of an
order from <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> by which the 6th French Army assumed a defensive
<span class="italic">rôle</span>, occupying the line
<span lang="fr">Soissons&mdash;Vic-sur-Aisne&mdash;Tracy-le-Val&mdash;Bailly</span>, pending the formation
of another Army to consist of four Corps (4th, 14th, 13th, and 20th
French) with two Cavalry Corps.</p>

<p>This Army was to concentrate at once to the <abbr title="north-west">N.W.</abbr> of <span lang="fr">Noyon</span>; it was
intended that it should operate in an easterly direction against the
enemy's flank, and it was placed under the command of <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>.</p>

<p>I had enjoyed the great advantage and privilege of a close
acquaintance with this distinguished French commander for some years
before the war, and in that time I had learnt enough of his splendid,
soldierlike character, and great capabilities as a leader, to
experience no surprise when actual war revealed his ability.</p>

<p>Although <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span> and the Army he commanded were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> not
successful in actually turning the enemy's flank and compelling his
retreat, I believe that history will assign to this great General the
honour of commanding the Army which drove the first big nail into the
German coffin, for it was the Army which struck the blow that changed
the line of battle from "east and west" to "north and south." <span lang="fr">De
Castelnau</span>, by the fine leading of that Army, built the first section
of the great besieging wall, which was destined to form an
impenetrable barrier between Germany and her main objectives.</p>

<p>In directing this great movement as he did, Marshal <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> must once
again be credited with one of those flashes of military genius which
have never been surpassed in the annals of war.</p>

<p>A somewhat significant and rather amusing example of Haig's power of
resource was shown on the 19th, when he arranged with the Zouaves on
his right to give them 10,000 rations of bully beef in exchange for
the loan of two heavy guns.</p>

<p>It was estimated that the enemy's attacks against the 1st Corps up to
this time had cost him at least 7,000 men. The dead were lying thick
in front of our trenches.</p>

<p>The fighting on the 19th September will always remain memorable to the
French, because on this day the Germans practically destroyed Rheims
Cathedral by artillery fire.</p>

<p>On the 20th I had a long conference with Haig at his Headquarters, and
afterwards visited both his Divisional Commanders (Lomax and Munro)
and also some of the Brigadiers.</p>

<p>The 1st Corps was indeed hard pressed, but was gallantly repulsing
all attacks. Nevertheless, it was suffering <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> heavy losses and
badly needed rest. I told Haig he could call upon the remaining two
brigades of the 6th Division (he already had the 18th Brigade in his
trenches) for reinforcement, if necessary.</p>

<p>Later in the day a violent attack on the 3rd Division (2nd Corps)
obliged me to place the 16th Brigade (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> the Buffs, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Leicester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Shropshire <abbr title="Light-Infantry">L.I.</abbr>, and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> York and
Lancs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>) at Smith-Dorrien's disposal. This left only the 17th
Brigade and Gough's cavalry in general reserve.</p>

<p>I told Haig he could call upon them if absolutely necessary, but asked
him to do without them if possible. Although he was heavily pressed he
finished the day without the aid of these troops.</p>

<p>The position of the three Reserve Divisions on the left of the 6th
French Army gave cause for great anxiety on this evening, as the
development of <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>'s movements to the north could not make
itself felt for some two or three days.</p>

<p>On the 21st I was able to effect a much needed relief of the troops
holding the trenches. The 16th Infantry Brigade of the 6th Division
relieved the 7th Infantry Brigade (3rd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Worcester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Lancs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Wilts <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Irish
Rifles) of the 3rd Division, the 7th Brigade joining the 6th Division
in general reserve at <span lang="fr">Couvrelles</span>. The 17th Infantry Brigade (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
<abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Fusiliers, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> Staffs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Leinster <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and
3rd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Rifle Brigade) relieved the 5th Infantry Brigade (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Worcester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Oxford and Bucks <abbr title="Light-Infantry">L.I.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Highland Light Infantry">H.L.I.</abbr>,
and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Connaught Rangers) of the 2nd Division, the latter
joining the 6th Division as general reserve at Dhuizel.</p>

<p>A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> significant result of our recent experience was that the
cavalry were calling out loudly for <span class="italic">bayonets</span>.</p>

<p>On this day Sir Henry Rawlinson arrived and reported himself. General
Snow having met with a severe accident owing to his horse falling, I
placed General Rawlinson in temporary command of the 4th Division.</p>

<p>General Maxwell, the newly appointed Inspector-General of Lines of
Communication, also reported his arrival.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 22nd I went out with Allenby to the extreme
right of Haig's position, where the cavalry were working, and made a
close reconnaissance of the ground over which the 1st Army Corps was
fighting.</p>

<p>We ascended the heights north of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> leading to the plateau
which lies to the south of the <span lang="fr">Chemin des Dames</span>, now so famous a
locality. The ground was thickly wooded up to the edge of the plateau,
and the winding narrow road led through small groups of rough houses
and buildings which seemed as if they had been hewn out of the rock.
The enemy's "Black Marias" constantly searched those roads in close
proximity; indeed, actually within the boundaries of these locations,
but still tiny children were to be seen playing beside the road all
unconscious of any danger.</p>

<p>Near the top of the ascent was an enormous crater or valley,
apparently of volcanic origin, which furnished covering and
concealment to a large force of Moroccan troops in reserve, who
completely filled it. They, like the children, seemed to be perfectly
oblivious of the high-explosive shell which often fell amongst them.
Lying about in their light blue and silver uniforms they presented a
very picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>On the night of the 22nd I got a letter from <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span> telling me that
the enemy was most certainly going away from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> his front, and
that he intended to advance and attack at 4 a.m. on the 23rd, and he
asked me to support him. I learned also that the 5th French Army on my
right was also planning an attack.</p>

<p>I arranged to co-operate accordingly, but by the night of the 23rd
very little progress had been effected.</p>

<p>After this I think all our eyes were turned eagerly towards the north
and to <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>, whilst, as to myself, I was more determined than
ever that my proper sphere of action was clearly on the Belgian
frontier in the north.</p>

<p>The 2nd French Army made decided progress up to the end of September,
but their action did not compel the enemy to evacuate his positions on
the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, nor did it seriously turn his flank.</p>

<p>On the 26th, <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span> was heavily engaged, and was on that evening
roughly on the line <span lang="fr">Ribécourt&mdash;Roye&mdash;Chaulnes&mdash;Bray-sur-Somme</span>, with one
Cavalry Division north of the Somme. On the 26th it was clear that the
flanking movement of the 2nd (French) Army had for the moment failed,
as the 2nd Bavarian Corps was on its left north of <span lang="fr">Péronne</span>.</p>

<p>By the 30th, <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span> was practically thrown on the defensive, and
another Army was composed of units drawn from the east. This Army was
intended to effect a turning movement pivoting on <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>'s left.</p>

<p>There are a few salient points in the history of these last few days
of the month which materially affected the course of the campaign.</p>

<p>On the 26th, Sir Charles Haddon, <del>Master General of the
Ordnance</del> <ins>President of the Ordnance Board, Woolwich Arsenal</ins>, arrived at my Headquarters to discuss the
question of armament and ammunition. I took this opportunity to
impress upon him how terribly deficient we were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> in heavy
artillery as compared with the Germans, and urged as strongly as I
possibly could that the manufacture of this class of ordnance, as well
as an abundance of ammunition, should be put in hand at once.</p>

<p>My official correspondence with the War Office on this vital subject
dates back to this time, and continued right up to June, 1915, when at
last Mr. Lloyd George came to the rescue and entered upon his career
of patriotic salvation. Britons all over the world will ever remember
this distinguished statesman with the utmost gratitude as one of the
greatest of their Empire's sons.</p>

<p>Only those who were in any degree associated with Mr. Lloyd George in
this time of trial can fully realise the awful responsibility which
rested upon him, and the difficult nature of the problem he had to
solve. His work was done in face of a dead weight of senseless but
powerful opposition, all of which he had to undermine and overcome.</p>

<p>In later pages of this volume I shall refer again to the subject of
deficiencies in armament and ammunition. I have mentioned it here
because I am firmly convinced that, had my advice with regard to it
been listened to and acted upon at the time, the War would have
finished long before it did, and untold suffering would have been
saved to the civilised world.</p>

<p>I think it was on September 24th that a few 6-inch siege howitzers
arrived and proved of great help to me.</p>

<p>As I am about to recount the <span class="italic" lang="fr">pourparlers</span> with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> which led up to
our move north, I am reminded that it was during these latter days of
September that my friend, Winston Churchill, paid me a visit. I think
of him in connection with this subject&mdash;quite apart from any question
of Antwerp, which was not then in danger&mdash;because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> it was at
that time that we first discussed together the advisability of joint
action by the Army and Navy. It was then that we sketched out plans
for an offensive with one flank towards the sea, which, although the
subsequent fall of Antwerp effected a drastic change in the
conditions, were the same in principle as those which took substantial
shape and form in the early days of 1915, and which will be recounted
in their proper place.</p>

<p>I cannot adequately express my sense of the valuable help which I
received throughout the War from Winston Churchill's assistance and
constant sympathy. Not only have I always indignantly repudiated the
shameful attacks which his countrymen have so often made upon him, but
it rejoices me to know that I have been able to do so&mdash;having a full
knowledge of all the facts&mdash;with a deep and true sense of the horrible
injustice of the charges brought against him. I shall have more to say
on this subject later.</p>

<p>On September 29th I addressed to the French Commander-in-Chief the
following note which was conveyed to him that evening by General
Wilson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ever since our position in the French line was altered by the advance
of General <span lang="fr">Maunoury</span>'s 6th Army to the River <span lang="fr">Ourcq</span>, I have been anxious
to regain my original position on the left flank of the French Armies.
On several occasions I have thought of suggesting this move, but the
strategical and tactical situation from day to day has made the
proposal inopportune. Now, however, that the position of affairs has
become clearly defined, and that the immediate future can be
forecasted with some confidence, I wish to press the proposal with all
the power and insistence which are at my disposal. The moment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> for the execution of such a move appears to me to be
singularly opportune.</p>

<p>"In the first place, the position of my force on the right bank of the
River <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> has now been thoroughly well entrenched.</p>

<p>"In the second place, I have carefully reconnoitred an alternative
position on the left bank of the River <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, and have had this
position entrenched from end to end, and it is now ready for
occupation.</p>

<p>"The strategical advantages of the proposed move are much greater. I
am expecting to be reinforced by the 7th Division from England early
next week.</p>

<p>"Following closely on this reinforcement will come the 3rd Cavalry
Division from home, and then the 8th Division from home, and
simultaneously with this last reinforcement will come two Indian
Divisions and an Indian Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>"In other words my present force of six Divisions and two Cavalry
Divisions will, within three or four weeks from now, be increased by
four Divisions and two Cavalry Divisions, making a total British force
of ten Divisions (five Corps) and four Cavalry Divisions.</p>

<p>"All through the present campaign I have been much restricted both in
initiative and in movement by the smallness of my Army in face of the
enormous numbers of the enemy.</p>

<p>"With an Army of five Corps and four Cavalry Divisions my freedom of
action, field of operation and power of initiative will be increased
out of all proportion to the numerical increase in Corps, more
especially as almost half my total force will then consist of fresh
troops and will be opposed by an enemy already much worn by the
severity of the previous fighting.</p>

<p>"Another <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> reason of a strategical nature for changing my
position in the line is the great advantage which my forces will gain
by a shortened line of communication, an advantage which falls almost
equally on your railways.</p>

<p>"It appears to me, therefore, that both from strategical reasons and
from tactical reasons it is desirable that the British Army should
regain its position on the left of the line.</p>

<p>"There remains the question of <span class="italic">when</span> this move should take place.</p>

"I submit that <span class="italic">now</span> is the time.

<p>"We are all sedentary armies, and movements and changes are easily
made. Once the forward movement has been commenced, it will be more
difficult to pull out my Army from the line of advance, and a further
delay in the transfer of my force from its present position will lead
to great confusion both at the front and on the <abbr title="line of communication">L. of C.</abbr>, and a great
loss of power and efficiency in the coming campaign.</p>

<p>"It is for these reasons that I advocate the transfer of my force from
its present position to the extreme left of the line, and I advocate
that the change should be made now."</p>

<p>On the 30th, I received the following reply from <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="left50">"Great General Headquarters Staff,</span><br>
<span class="left70">"3rd Bureau,</span><br>
<span class="left60">"September 30th, 1914.</span></p>

<p>"Note by General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, Commander-in-Chief, to Marshal French,
Commanding British Army.</p>

<p>"His Excellency, Marshal French, has been good enough to draw the
attention of the Commander-in-Chief to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> the particular
interest attaching to the proposal that the British Army should
reoccupy the position which it originally held on the left of the
French Armies.</p>

<p>"In view of the ever-increasing strength of the British Forces, this
position would offer great advantages in lightening the work of the
French railways and diminishing the length of the British line of
communication, and, above all, in giving to Marshal French's Army a
liberty of action and of power very superior to those it now
possesses.</p>

<p>"The increase of strength which will shortly accrue to the British
Army by the arrival of the 7th and 8th Divisions and a Division of
Cavalry, and the two Indian Divisions and one Cavalry Division from
India entirely justifies the Marshal's request. The Commander-in-Chief
shares this view, and is persuaded that if this movement had been
possible it would have been very advantageous for the Allied Armies;
but so far the general situation has not admitted of this being
carried out.</p>

<p>"Is it possible at this moment to contemplate its realisation in the
future? His Excellency, Marshal French thinks that the present moment
is particularly favourable to his project. In front of the British
line, as also in front of the 6th, 9th, and 4th Armies, the situation
is, so to speak, unchanged. For nearly 15 days the Armies of the
centre have been <span class="italic" lang="fr">accrochées</span> to the ground without making any real
advance. There have been violent attacks and periods of calm, but the
Commander-in-Chief wishes to point out that this is far from being the
case on the wings.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, on the right, the 3rd Army and a portion of the
1st Army for several days in the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mihiel</span> have been
fighting an obstinate battle, the issue of which is not in doubt, but
the results of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> which have not yet made themselves felt. On
the left, the 2nd Army, which to-day forms the extreme flank of the
line has for three days past been the object of furious attacks, which
show how important it is for the enemy to crush our wing.</p>

<p>"Will this Army always form the left of the French forces? We cannot
think so, because the fact that to-day the Army there has been
subdivided will doubtless lead the Commander-in-Chief to form a new
Army there; the transport of troops necessitated by the creation of
this Army, formed from elements taken away from the front without
leaving a gap in our line, must of necessity render our situation
somewhat delicate for some days.</p>

<p>"If the Commander-in-Chief has contemplated the possibility of
withdrawing a certain number of Corps without modifying his front, he
has never thought of transporting an entire Army, the removal of which
would create a gap impossible to fill.</p>

<p>"The battle has been going on since September 13th. It is necessary
that during this period of crisis, which will have considerable
influence on the subsequent operations, everyone should maintain his
position without thinking of modifying it, so as to be ready for all
eventualities.</p>

<p>"Now, the movement contemplated by His Excellency Marshal French would
inevitably entail complications, not only in the position of troops
but also in those of supply trains, etc. It might possibly create
confusion in the general dispositions of our Armies, the extent of
which it would be difficult to measure.</p>

<p>"For the above reasons the Commander-in-Chief cannot share the view of
Marshal French as to the time at which this movement should be carried
out; on the other hand, it appears that it might be possible to begin
it from to-day onwards <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> by making certain dispositions, the
detail of which is given below:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>"1. The British Army might operate like the French Army. It is to-day
strongly entrenched in the positions which it occupies. While
maintaining the integrity of its front, it might doubtless be possible
for it to withdraw a certain number of divisions (to begin with one
Corps), which might in succession be transported to the left.</p>

<p>"2. The British Cavalry Division is at the present moment unemployed
on the front; it might, similarly to the 11th and 10th Corps and 8th
Division of Cavalry, move by rail or by march route to the extreme
left to act as a communicating link between the Belgian Army and the
French troops.</p>

<p>"3. The 7th and 8th Divisions, which will shortly arrive, could be
disembarked in the neighbourhood of Dunkirk. They would subsequently
operate in the direction of Lille. Their action would immediately make
itself felt on the right flank of the German Army, which daily
receives fresh reinforcements. These divisions would be joined to the
divisions withdrawn from the front.</p>

<p>"4 The Indian Divisions, as soon as they are able to take the field,
would move by rail to join the English formations assembled in the
northern region, and would form the nucleus with which would be united
the other British Divisions as soon as they should be removed.</p>

<p>"5. As soon as the advance can be resumed, the front will be narrowed;
it would then be possible for the English to halt and slip behind with
a view to moving the left of the line while the 6th and 5th <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span>
Armies close in towards each other. The fewer units remaining to be
moved, the easier would be the operation.</p>
</div>

<p>"To sum up, the Commander-in-Chief shares Marshal French's view that
it is desirable for the whole British Army to be on the left of the
French Armies, but cannot be entirely of the same opinion as to the
time at which this movement should be carried out.</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief would be grateful to His Excellency, Marshal
French, if the latter would let him know whether he shares his views
as to the proposals indicated above."</p>

<p>On the same date, I replied to the Commander-in-Chief as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left60">"September 30th, 1914.</p>

<p>"Note by the Field Marshal Commander-in-Chief, British Forces, to His
Excellency the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>"The Field-Marshal Commander-in-Chief, British Forces, has received
the note which His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief has been kind
enough to address to him, in reply to his Memorandum of the 29th
instant.</p>

<p>"Sir John French entirely agrees with the views expressed, and will
give effect to them at once in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>"1. The 2nd Cavalry Division, consisting of two Brigades under the
command of Major-General Gough, which is now located in rear of the
left of the line held by the British Forces, will hold itself in
readiness to proceed to whatever point on the railway His Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief may decide upon, to be moved thence to Lille,
if that place should be decided upon as the point upon which the
British Forces <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> should first concentrate on reaching the left
of the Allied line.</p>

<p>"2. As soon as trains are available, the Field-Marshal
Commanding-in-Chief will disengage the 2nd British Corps which now
occupies the centre of the British line. This Corps will concentrate
in rear and be ready to move by the same route and for the same
destination as the 2nd Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>"3. In like manner, the 19th Infantry Brigade will be held in
readiness to move immediately after the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>"4. The position in the centre of the British line, held now by the
two Divisions of the 2nd Corps, will be divided between the 1st Corps,
now occupying the left of the British line, in such a manner as to
unite the inward flanks of the two Corps; whilst the 1st Cavalry
Division will be held as a reserve south of the river.</p>

<p>"5. The Field Marshal understands that, as soon as a forward move by
the whole line becomes feasible, these two corps and the 1st Cavalry
Division will remain behind, their places being filled up by closing
in the 5th and 6th French Armies on their inward flanks.</p>

<p>"6. The Field Marshal will immediately inform the British Secretary of
State for War of these arrangements, and will ask that the 7th and 8th
Divisions may be moved as soon as practicable <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> or <span lang="fr">Havre</span>
to join the British forces concentrating at Lille.</p>

<p>"7. The Indian Division will be directed to move in accordance with
the views expressed in the note of September 30th.</p>
</div>

<p>"Sir <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> John French hopes that these proposals will meet with
the approval of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief."</p>

<p>The following was General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s reply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left60">October 1st, 1914.

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces has the honour to
acknowledge receipt of the letter of His Excellency the Field Marshal
Commanding the British Army, dated September 30th, referring to the
future movements which are to be carried out by this Army.</p>

<p>"He is happy to be able to comply with the wishes expressed by the
Field Marshal and to state, once more, the entire unanimity of views
which exists between the Commanders of the Allied Armies. At the same
time, owing to the necessities of the railway service, it is not
possible to commence entraining before the afternoon of October 5th.</p>

<p>"Referring to the points touched on in the letter of September 30th,
and in accordance with the views given by the Field Marshal, it is
suggested that the following instructions might be given:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>"1. The 2nd Cavalry Division (two brigades under the command of <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr>
Gough) should move by road, owing to the lateness of the date on which
entrainment becomes possible. They should move in rear of the 6th and
2nd Armies, by <span lang="fr">Villers-Cotterets&mdash;La Croix&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ouen&mdash;Amiens&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Pol&mdash;Lille</span> (similarly to the 8th and 10th French Divisions).</p>

<p>"2. The 2nd Corps should march to the area <span lang="fr">Longueil&mdash;Pont <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maxence</span>,
by October 5th, to be moved by rail to the Lille district, its place
on the front held by the British to be taken as arranged by the Field
Marshal in his letter of September 30th.</p>

<p>"3. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> The 19th Infantry Brigade to be in readiness to follow
the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>"4. As regards the two Corps and the Cavalry Division remaining at the
front, it would appear inconvenient to leave them halted there when
the general advance of the whole line becomes possible.</p>
</div>

<p>"Apart from the unfairness of depriving the British troops of the
satisfaction of advancing after their valiant fighting, it will be
more convenient to halt them successively, as the closing in of the
inner flank of the 5th and 6th Armies shortens the front allotted to
the British Army.</p>

<p>"It would be advisable for the Commander-in-Chief and the Field
Marshal to arrange mutually, at some convenient date, the conditions
under which the transport of these troops by rail should be made.</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>"5. Referring to the disembarkation of the 7th and 8th Divisions, the
Commander-in-Chief is most anxious that these two Divisions should
proceed as soon as possible to <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span>. Their arrival at Lille, where
they are to join the British Forces pushed to the front, would then be
more rapid than if they were disembarked at <span lang="fr">Havre</span> and the arrangements
would be simpler. Their movement from the port of landing could be
carried out by road with the assistance of the railway for marching
troops.</p>

<p>"6. The Indian Divisions should be moved to the neighbourhood of Lille
as soon as the Field Marshal reports that they are ready.</p>
</div>

<p>"The <abbr title="general officer">G.O.</abbr> <abbr title="commanding-in-charge">C.-in-C.</abbr> hopes that these proposals are in accordance with
the views expressed by the Field Marshal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> in his letter of
September 30th, and he would be glad to be assured of this as soon as
possible in order that steps may be taken to execute them.</p>

<p class="left50">(Signed) <span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap" lang="fr">J. Joffre</span>."</span></p>

<p>I acknowledged the above in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left70">"October 1st, 1914.</p>

<p>"The Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the British Forces has duly
received the note dated October 1st, 1914, from His Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>"He is extremely glad to find that the proposals contained in his last
note meet with the approval of the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>"Such modifications as are suggested in the present note are perfectly
feasible, and Sir John French will give immediate effect to them.</p>

<p>"The necessary orders were issued to-day, and the preliminary
movements are now in progress.</p>

<p>"The Field Marshal hopes that the 2nd Cavalry Division will commence
its march towards Lille on the morning of October 3rd."<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span></h3>

<h4>THE SIEGE AND FALL OF ANTWERP</h4>

<p>In our appreciation of the situation at British Headquarters on
October 1st it was considered that the reduction of Antwerp was at
this moment the great objective of the enemy. Personally, I had no
reason to think that Antwerp was in any immediate danger, and
therefore a message which I received from the Secretary of State on
October 2nd came as a most disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>I was informed that a serious situation had been created at Antwerp,
which was in grave danger of falling in a short time.</p>

<p>Further information reached me at 3 a.m. on the 3rd from London that
the Belgian Government, acting on the advice unanimously given by the
Superior Council of War in the presence of the King, had decided to
leave at once for Ostend. It was further stated that the King, with
the Field Army, would withdraw from Antwerp in the direction of Ghent
to protect the coast-line and in the hope of being able to co-operate
with the Allied Armies. The message added that the town could hold out
for five or six days, and that the decision to evacuate was taken very
seriously as a result of the increasingly critical situation.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that I was perturbed on receipt of this news, It
was difficult to understand why the Belgians, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> who had fought
so well at <span lang="fr">Liége</span>, were unable to do more in defence of a fortress
which was much stronger, and situated, moreover, in a position where
it could be supported by the British Fleet.</p>

<p>I fully realised the consequence of the capture and occupation of
Antwerp by the Germans. It was impossible to say how much of the
coast-line the captured <span class="italic">terrain</span> would include, but there could be no
doubt that the Channel ports would be gravely imperilled.</p>

<p>Operating from such a base, there would appear to be no insuperable
obstacle to an immediate German advance on Dunkirk, Calais, and
<span lang="fr">Boulogne</span>. The Belgian Army was in no condition to resist such an
advance. The occupation of these places and the formation of a
defensive line which would include the whole of the Pas-de-Calais,
might become a <span class="italic" lang="fr">fait accompli</span> before the troops could arrive from the
main theatres to prevent it.</p>

<p>But here, again, we have an example of the over-confidence which for
ever possessed that army which set out for "world conquest." As on the
<span lang="fr">Marne</span>, so at Antwerp, they were not prepared to seize the
psychological moment and to play boldly for the great stake.</p>

<p>It is seldom that fortune offers another chance to a military leader
who has once failed to gather the rich harvest which she has put into
his grasp. Yet the German Emperor presents, together with his great
General Staff, one of the few instances in history of a
Commander-in-Chief so soon being given a splendid opportunity to
retrieve such mistakes as those of September 5th and 6th.</p>

<p>With all these tragic possibilities in my mind in these early October
days, I redoubled my endeavours to effect a speedy move of the British
forces to the north. Added to the other cogent reasons to which I
referred in the last chapter <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> was now the most vital of
all&mdash;the relief of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener did not make things easy for me.</p>

<p>Keenly desirous to influence the course of operations, his telegrams
followed one after another each containing "directions" regarding a
local situation of which, in London, he could know very little.</p>

<p>For instance, in one message he told me he was communicating with
General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and the French Government, but, as he did not do so
through me, I was quite unaware of what was passing between them, yet
all the time he was urging me to make what I knew to be impracticable
suggestions to General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>. This could only lead to
misunderstandings and confusion of ideas, and I must repudiate any
responsibility whatever for what happened in the north during the
first ten days of October. I was explicitly told by the Secretary of
State for War that the British troops operating there were not under
my command, as the following telegram shows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have already given Rawlinson temporary rank. I am sending him
instructions regarding his action Antwerp. The troops employed there
will not for the present be considered part of your force."</p>

<p>Rawlinson, I may remark, had been sent for to meet the 7th Division at
Ostend and take command of it.</p>

<p>Had I been left to exercise my full functions as Commander-in-Chief of
the British Army in France, I should certainly have made different
dispositions with regard to the disposal of these troops. I regret
that I must record my deliberate opinion that the best which could
have been done throughout this critical situation was <span class="italic">not</span> done,
owing entirely to Lord Kitchener's endeavour to unite in himself the
separate and distinct <span class="italic">rôles</span> of a Cabinet Minister in London
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> and a Commander-in-Chief in France. I feel it only right and
in the interest of my country, with a view to any war we may be
engaged in in the future, to make this plain statement of fact. The
calamity at Sedan was due in part to interference from Paris with the
Army in the field, and the American Civil War was more than probably
prolonged by the repeated interference on the part of the Secretary of
State with the Commanders in the field.</p>

<p>As to the method of employing the 7th Infantry and 3rd Cavalry
Divisions, the following telegram will show that the French
Commander-in-Chief completely concurred in my views:&mdash;</p>

<p>"General Commanding-in-Chief to <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <span lang="fr">Huguet</span>, October 8th, 8.45 a.m.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief has the honour to inform Marshal French that
he entirely agrees with the ideas on the subject of employing the
whole of the British Forces united.</p>

<p>"He estimates that, in the actual situation of Antwerp, the
reinforcement of the garrison by the 7th English Division will not
have any effect on the fate of the place.</p>

<p>"In these conditions he believes on the contrary that it is very
advantageous that this English Division should unite as early as
possible with the main body of the British Forces in the northern
zone.</p>

<p>"Will the Marshal be kind enough to inform Lord Kitchener of the
Commander-in-Chief's views of the situation?</p>

<p>"He will ask the President of the Republic to confirm these views to
the British War Minister."</p>

<p>As to the confusion of ideas to which I have referred, the following
telegram which I found it necessary to address to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> the
Commander of the 7th Division, Sir Henry Rawlinson, will show that it
existed up to the 11th instant:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your message <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 19, addressed to Lord Kitchener and repeated to me,
received. I really do not understand whether you regard yourself as
under my orders or not; but if you do, please be good enough to
explain your situation clearly without delay, as I have no knowledge
of any necessity for your re-embarkation or of your intention to do
so.</p>

<p>"Hazebrouck will be in occupation of the 3rd Corps to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>"Be good enough to answer me by some means at once, as my own and
General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s plans are much put out and perhaps compromised by all
this misunderstanding."</p>

<p>To this Rawlinson replied that he was under my orders, and proceeded
to give me the information I requested.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the general atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty in
which I had to work after the fall of Antwerp until towards the 10th
of the month (October), when at length the Secretary of State for War
consented to allow me full liberty of action to direct the movements
of all British Forces in France.</p>

<p>Some 3,000 marines had been landed in Dunkirk towards the end of
September and, when Antwerp was threatened, Lord Kitchener&mdash;saying
nothing of it to me&mdash;arranged with General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> that the latter
should send one or two French Territorial Divisions to join them and
act with them.</p>

<p>The first intimation I had of this was a wire from Lord Kitchener,
received late at night on October 3rd, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not know when the two Divisions promised by the French
Government from <span lang="fr">Havre</span> will be able to start.</p>

<p>"Could <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> you ascertain this and let me know your views on the
situation and how you contemplate acting?"</p>

<p>To this I replied in the early hours of the 4th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not know what has passed direct between English and French
Governments, but French General Headquarters told me positively in
answer to repeated enquiry that they are only sending one Territorial
Division from <span lang="fr">Havre</span> to Ostend, which they say is to start at once by
sea.</p>

<p>"With reference to the last sentence in your message 1315, please
refer to my message F272 dispatched last night at 7.30. I shall get
report from officer I sent yesterday to Bruges and Antwerp directly
and will wire again."</p>

<p>That part of my message F272 (referred to above), which bears on the
subject, runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"French wish us to use <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> for 7th Division and Cavalry to
disembark.... I am strongly averse to sending any troops inside the
fortress (of Antwerp) even if they could be got there."</p>

<p>General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s telegram for me of October 8th has already been
quoted, and I had previously been in constant communication with him
on this subject. When I dispatched telegram F272 I knew that <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s
views accorded with my own.</p>

<p>That the wishes of the Allied Commanders were ignored in London is
further shown by the following message received by me from the
Secretary of State for War at 2.30 p.m. on October 4th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am embarking 7th Division and portion of Cavalry Division to-day,
but I cannot get report from Antwerp on the military situation from
which I can decide where they should be disembarked.</p>

<p>"My present opinion is Zeebrugge, where there are good <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span>
landing facilities. Can you send Rawlinson by motor to Antwerp to take
charge and study the situation before the troops arrive?"</p>

<p>This message was amplified by the following message which was sent
later in the day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am arranging following Expeditionary Force for relief Antwerp:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">British Force</span>:</p>

<p>"7th Division, under <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Capper, 18,000 men, 63 guns; Cavalry
Division, under <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Byng, 4,000 men, 12 guns. To arrive at Zeebrugge
October 6th and October 7th.</p>

<p>"Naval detachments under <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Alston, 8,000 men, already there; also
naval and military heavy guns and detachments already sent.
Headquarters Staff will be subsequently notified.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">French Force</span>:</p>

<p>"Territorial Division, <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Roy, 15,000 men, proper complement guns
and two squadrons to arrive Ostend October 6th to October 9th;
Fusiliers Marins Brigade under Rear-Admiral Ronarch, 8,000 men; grand
total, 53,000 men. Numbers are approximately correct."</p>

<p>In order to summarise the situation as it was reflected in my mind at
this time, I will quote two more telegrams.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener wired on the early morning of the 6th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please let me have a telegraphic appreciation of the situation of the
Allied Forces for information of the Government."</p>

<p>To which the following reply was sent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allied line extends from <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span>, about 14 miles south-west of
<span lang="fr">Lille</span> on the left, through <span lang="fr">Arras</span>, east of <span lang="fr">Albert, Bray-sur-Somme</span>, west
of <span lang="fr">Roye, Ribécourt, Nampcelle, Nouvron</span>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> <span lang="fr">Soissons</span>, north of
<span lang="fr">Braye-en-Laonnois, Craonnelle, Berry-au-Bac</span>, then south of <span lang="fr">Rheims</span>,
then east to <span lang="fr">Verdun</span>, then south to <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mihiel</span>, then east to
<span lang="fr">Thiaucourt</span>.</p>

<p>"On the extreme left is the 21st French Corps, with two Cavalry Corps
operating between <span lang="fr">Carvin</span> and <span lang="fr">Lens</span>.</p>

<p>"Hard fighting north of the Oise, where strength of French Force
equivalent to 12 Corps and six Cavalry Divisions. Comparative quiet on
the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>; British forces in progress of evacuating positions and
moving north of the Somme near <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span>; move should be completed by
the 20th instant.</p>

<p>"The German line extends from about <span lang="fr">Lille</span>, roughly parallel to the
Allies, west of <span lang="fr">Bapaume, Chaulnes, Roye</span>, south of <span lang="fr">Noyon</span>, thence along
the hills north of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> to <span lang="fr">Craonne, Brimont, Nogent-l'Abbesse,
Somme Py</span>, north-east of <span lang="fr">Verdun</span>, where it turns south to
<span lang="fr">Fresnes-en-Woevre</span>, then to near <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mihiel, Thiaucourt</span>, and east of
<span lang="fr">Thiaucourt</span>.</p>

<p>"The strength of the Germans north of the Oise is probably 11 Corps
and nine Cavalry Divisions in position. In addition to the above
forces, one Brigade was detraining at <span lang="fr">Cambrai</span> yesterday, and reserve
troops are holding entrenched positions about <span lang="fr">Mons</span> and <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>,
numbers variously reported from 50,000 to 70,000.</p>

<p>"The object of the Allies is to bring about a retirement of the
Germans from their present line by turning their north flank, and at
the same time to hold in this theatre of operations as many German
Corps as possible. French General Headquarters anticipated that the
northern turning movement would have been facilitated by the close
co-operation of the Belgian Field Army.</p>

<p>"So far as I am able to have an object apart from the general French
view of the situation, I place the relief of Antwerp <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> as of
first importance as regards forces under my command."</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener had dispatched these troops <span class="italic">en route</span> to Antwerp
itself before he even asked me for an appreciation of the general
situation.</p>

<p>The history of the rapid investment and fall of Antwerp, the
evacuation of Ostend and Zeebrugge and the retreat of the Belgians to
the Yser, is very well known now, and it is not my intention to go
over the ground again here; but I feel sure that, had the views of the
Commanders in the field (<span lang="fr">Joffre</span> and myself) been accepted, a much
better and easier situation would have been created.</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear that the operations for the relief of Antwerp
should never have been directed from London.</p>

<p>It should have been left entirely in the hands of the French
Commander-in-Chief (or in mine acting with him) to decide upon the
dispositions and destination of the troops immediately they left
British shores. We alone were in a position to judge as to the best
methods by which to co-ordinate the objectives and distribute the
troops between the northern and southern theatres.</p>

<p>As things actually turned out, the troops which were landed at Ostend
and Zeebrugge had (to quote from General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s wire to <span lang="fr">Huguet</span> on
October 8th) no influence on the fate of the fortress, and what help
they were in protecting the retreat of the Belgians and saving that
Army from destruction might have been equally well rendered from a
safer and more effective direction. This would not have necessitated
that dangerous and exhausting flank march, costing such terrible loss,
by which alone they were able eventually to unite with the main
British forces.</p>

<p>Dispatched from England on October 5th or 6th, and disembarking at
Calais or <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> (Dunkirk could have been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> used if the
Belgian Army had required more help), they would have deployed six or
seven days later in the valley of the Lys south of the 3rd Corps, and
Lille might have been saved.</p>

<p>It is quite possible also to conceive a situation starting from these
preliminary dispositions, which would have resulted in saving Ostend,
even Zeebrugge and that line of coast, the possession of which by the
enemy, dating from October, 1914, was a source of such infinite
trouble to us.</p>

<p>Although I was given no voice in these Antwerp dispositions, and was
left in partial ignorance of what was going on, which, in my position
as Commander-in-Chief, was deplorable&mdash;I took what steps I could to
keep in close touch with the progress of events.</p>

<p>Colonel Bridges of the 4th Dragoon Guards was with his regiment in the
Cavalry Division. He had formerly been Military <span lang="fr">Attaché</span> in Brussels
and understood the Belgians well. He had already greatly distinguished
himself in earlier battles, and I sent for him.</p>

<p>Bridges commenced the War as a squadron commander, and it will always
be a matter of deep gratification to me that I was enabled to see him
in command of a Division before I gave up the Army in France.</p>

<p>Of tall and spare figure, his face has always struck me as that of an
ideal leader of men. He has an absolute contempt of any personal
danger, and was constantly putting himself in the most exposed
positions, so that I was often in dread of losing him. I know he was
hit slightly once or twice and said nothing about it, but on another
occasion he was so severely wounded that for a day or two his life was
in danger. He was calm, quiet and very deliberate in all situations,
and his reports were of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> the utmost value. He never appeared
to want anything in the way of personal comfort, was quite indifferent
in any weather as to whether he slept on a bed or on the ground, and
had a happy knack of seeming delighted to start on any mission however
difficult and dangerous, or for any place however distant, with
nothing but the clothes he stood up in.</p>

<p>I wish I could describe Tom Bridges better. He is a typical fighting
soldier and leader, and I have entertained the deepest regard for him
ever since we first met many years ago. I certainly had hoped ere this
to have seen him in command of an Army Corps.</p>

<p>In accordance with my instructions he arrived at my Headquarters
during the night of October 3rd-4th. I dispatched him at 5 a.m. on the
4th by motor to Brussels, instructing him to get into immediate
communication with the Belgian General Staff and endeavour to persuade
them to hang on to Antwerp, promising support from us so soon as we
could possibly get to them.</p>

<p>Colonel Sykes was at that time second to Sir David Henderson in
command of the Royal Flying Corps. I sent him by aeroplane in the same
direction, telling him to find out all he could and bring me back a
report from Bridges.</p>

<p>I directed Sir David Henderson to establish air reconnaissances
towards Antwerp, which he did.</p>

<p>Finally, I did my utmost to expedite the move of all the British
Forces to the northern theatre. It appeared likely that there might be
considerable delay in relieving the 1st Corps. I therefore dispatched
Henry Wilson to General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> with the following note, dated October
4th, 1914:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With reference to Sir John French's note and the importance,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> therein dwelt upon, of the earliest possible relief of the
1st Corps from its present position, he suggests to His Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief the possibility of an extension by the 18th Corps
of its line to the left, as far as the point where the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> Canal
passes through the line of entrenchment occupied by the 1st Corps in
the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Braye</span>.</p>

<p>"In this connection Sir John French would particularly bring to the
notice of His Excellency the greatly increased strength of the
entrenchment by reason of the work which has been carried out during
the long time it has been under occupation by the 1st Corps. He would
also point out that the enemy is now much weaker than before, and that
such feeble attempts as he makes on the line of entrenchment are
entirely in the nature of reconnaissances, with a view to discover
whether the entrenchment is still held or not. Another consideration
of importance is that the line now held by the 18th Corps and French
troops attached to it is much less in extent than that occupied by the
British 1st Corps.</p>

<p>"In these circumstances Sir John French trusts that His Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief will be able to give such orders as will ensure the
troops occupying the portion of the line extending from the right of
the British entrenchment to the canal being relieved by troops from
the 18th Corps, the change to be carried out on the night of 6th-7th
October."</p>

<p>To this General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"General Wilson has been good enough to convey the desire expressed by
His Excellency Marshal French to see the whole of the British Army
follow the move of the 2nd Army Corps to the left wing of the Allies
line.</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief has the honour to state that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> he will
endeavour to satisfy this request, but as already stated in Note <abbr title="number">No.</abbr>
159 of October 1st the movement of the British troops can only be
carried out in succession.</p>

<p>"The heavy task with which the railway service is at present burdened,
and the difficulty of immediately replacing on the front all the
British units employed there, render it impossible to contemplate the
simultaneous withdrawal of all the British forces.</p>

<p>"A French Division will arrive to-morrow in the area of <span lang="fr">Soissons</span>. Its
billeting area is fixed by the <abbr title="general officer commanding-in-charge">G.O.C.</abbr> 6th Army and it is intended to
relieve the 3rd Army Corps. When this Corps has been withdrawn from
the front it will march to the area <span lang="fr">Compiègne&mdash;Longueil&mdash;Pont <abbr title="Sainte">Ste.</abbr>
Maxence</span>, where it will entrain in its turn. The route to be followed
can be decided upon by agreement with the <abbr title="general officer commanding-in-charge">G.O.C.</abbr> 6th Army. Admitting
that the relief can be carried out on the night, October 5th-6th, the
3rd Corps, taking three days to march to the neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Pont
<abbr title="Sainte">Ste.</abbr> Maxence</span>, will be ready to entrain on October 9th.</p>

<p>"With regard to the movement of the 1st Army Corps it is impossible at
present to decide the date at which its withdrawal can be carried out.
Indeed, its withdrawal will depend on the general situation, the
difficulty of bringing up other troops to be taken from the front to
replace the 1st Army Corps, and finally on the tasks imposed on the
railway service, but the Commander-in-Chief begs once more to assure
Marshal French that he will make the greatest efforts to concentrate
the whole of the British Army in the north. He takes note that the
Commander of the British troops wishes to see his forces concentrated
with all speed.</p>

<p>"The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span> 1st Cavalry Division will move by march route as has
already been done by <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Gough's Division.</p>

<p>"Regarding the detrainment area, Lille was first of all regarded as
the centre, but in view of existing circumstances it appears difficult
to determine as yet in what area the 2nd Corps now in course of
transport can be detrained. This Corps will have finished detraining
on the 8th and will be ready to act on the 9th. The most favourable
area for detraining appears to be that of <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>-Hazebrouck.</p>

<p>"The 3rd Corps, having been withdrawn from the front on the 6th and
entraining on the 9th, will be detrained on the 12th in the same area.
It will be ready to act on the 13th.</p>

<p>"Lastly, the Commander-in-Chief reiterates the request already made in
the note of October 1st that the 7th British Division may be
disembarked at <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> with the least possible delay. As soon as this
Division has been assembled, it will move by march route to join the
2nd and 3rd Corps. No precise indications can be given as to the date
on which this junction will be effected, as it will depend on the date
of arrival in France of the 7th Division, which date the
Commander-in-Chief is not in a position to decide.</p>

<p>"The Indian Divisions will join the British Army as soon as desired by
Marshal French.</p>

<p>"In order to strengthen the forces in this part of the theatre of
operations the request made to the French Government by His Excellency
Lord Kitchener has been responded to by sending to Dunkirk two
Territorial Divisions, one going from <span lang="fr">Havre</span> by sea and the other
railed from Paris without in any way retarding the movement of the
British Army.</p>

<p>"These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> are the dispositions that have been made with regard
to the movements to be carried out in the immediate future. The
Commander-in-Chief, however, wishes to lay particular stress on the
following considerations. The operations in progress necessitate the
constant reinforcement of our left wing by troops taken away from
different portions of the front. The movements carried out at Marshal
French's request, which can only be effected in succession will
result&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>"<span class="italic">Firstly.</span>&mdash;In temporarily dividing the British Army in two.</li>
<li>"<span class="italic">Secondly.</span>&mdash;In preventing for nearly ten days all movement of
     French troops to the north and, in consequence, creating a
     serious delay in the realisation of the operations contemplated.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Now it is of capital importance for the success of the operations
that all movements made to the north, either English or French, should
immediately contribute to the same object, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, to arrest and
outflank the German right wing. The result will certainly not be
achieved should His Excellency Marshal French propose to defer his
action until all his forces are concentrated. It would be advantageous
to have time enough to complete the English movement so that the
British Army could be engaged all at once, but it appears certain that
events will decide otherwise.</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief may be forced to ask Marshal French to
co-operate with British Divisions as they detrain and without waiting
for the whole of the detrainment to be carried out. He would be
obliged to consider the case of the retreat of the left wing, the
extent of which he would not be in a position to limit, if with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> object of carrying out a concentration which, though
certainly advantageous, is not indispensable, some Divisions remained
inactive at the time when the fate of the campaign was being decided;
moreover, it is to be noted that the enemy on his side engages as he
detrains; we cannot act differently.</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief feels sure that His Excellency Marshal French
will be good enough to examine this question of capital importance
with all the attention it deserves, and will take the necessary action
without which the gravest consequences must be faced.</p>

<p>"To sum up, the Commander-in-Chief has the honour to submit to His
Excellency Marshal French the following points on which he begs His
Excellency may be good enough to give a prompt reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>"1. Transport of the 2nd Army Corps to the same area, Hazebrouck,
completed the 9th.</p>

<p>"2. Transport of the 3rd Corps to the same area, completed the 13th.</p>

<p>"3. Lastly, and this is the essential point, without which the fate of
the campaign may be compromised, the possibility of engaging the
British Divisions in the north as they arrive, without waiting for the
British Army to be concentrated.</p>
</div>

<p>"The task of the British Army now in the general operations should,
therefore, be constantly to prolong the general line as it detrains,
in order to outflank the enemy and thus to join hands with the Belgian
Army.</p>

<p>"The support of our Cavalry Corps operating in the northern area will
always be given."</p>

<p>I answered thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir John French has duly received His Excellency's note 791 for which
he begs to offer him his best thanks.</p>

<p>"The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> arrangements therein proposed are perfectly
satisfactory, and the <span class="italic">rôle</span> which the British Army can fulfil on the
left flank of the Allied Force will, Sir John French hopes and
believes, tend best to the efficient progress of the campaign.</p>

<p>"He can assure His Excellency of the very best support of the British
Army at all times; and, should necessity arise, the various units, as
they arrive in the new area, will on no account be held back to await
a general concentration, if and when their immediate action is
demanded by the exigencies of the campaign.</p>

<p>"Sir John French would like to point out particularly to His
Excellency that the possibility of his having to engage his forces,
unit by unit, before the entire force is concentrated, offers another
great reason why it is most essential that the relief of the 1st Army
Corps from its present position should be effected with the least
possible delay.</p>

<p>"Whilst feeling quite assured that His Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief will do his utmost to effect this, Sir John French
feels that it is most necessary to insist upon the vast importance of
the presence of all the British Forces on the left flank at the
earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>"His Majesty's Government feel great anxiety as to the condition of
the Fortress of Antwerp, the fall of which stronghold would have
far-reaching consequences, political, material and moral.</p>

<p>"Sir John French is now in close daily communication with the Belgian
Commandant of the Fortress, and if he can daily assure him that there
is no delay in a movement which must have the ultimate effect of
relieving the situation at Antwerp, so long as that place is able to
hold <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> out, it should prove a great encouragement to the
garrison.</p>

<p>"Sir John French will address another note later on to His Excellency
on the subject of the Indian Divisions.</p>

<p>"Sir John French wishes to call His Excellency's attention to the fact
that the 2nd Corps will not complete its detrainment until the evening
of the 9th instant, and therefore will not be ready to act until the
10th instant. In his memorandum His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief
states as follows, referring to the 2nd Corps: This Corps will have
finished detraining on the 8th and will be ready to act on the 9th."</p>

<p class="p2">Antwerp fell on the 9th October and was followed by the retirement of
the Belgian Army to the line of the Yser.</p>

<p>The 7th Infantry and 3rd Cavalry Divisions were not placed under my
orders until October 10th. From that date, however, I will commence to
chronicle their doings.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span></h3>

<h4>THE LAST DAYS OF THE BRITISH OPERATIONS ON THE <span lang="fr">AISNE</span>&mdash;THE NORTHERN
MOVE</h4>

<p>I spent some hours on October 1st closely examining the centre of the
enemy's position on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, and arrived at the conclusion that
troops had certainly been withdrawn and that the Germans were weaker
in strength. I was not, moreover, apprehensive of any great difficulty
in effecting our withdrawal from the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> front, and I prepared at
once to carry out the arrangements made with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>.</p>

<p>Operation orders were issued ordering the 2nd Corps (less the 16th
Infantry Brigade) to withdraw during the nights of October 1st-2nd and
2nd-3rd, and assemble in the area <span lang="fr">Cuiry&mdash;Houssé&mdash;Oulchy-le-Château</span>
with a view to moving to <span lang="fr">Pont <abbr title="Sainte">Ste.</abbr> Maxence</span> (12 miles south-west of
<span lang="fr">Compiègne</span>), there to entrain for the left flank; the 1st and 3rd Corps
and 1st Cavalry Division to be withdrawn when opportunity occurred;
the 2nd Cavalry Division and 19th Infantry Brigade to follow the 2nd
Corps; the 1st Corps and 16th Infantry Brigade to take over positions
at the moment held by the 3rd Division; the 3rd Corps to take over
those held by the 5th Division.</p>

<p>I certainly entertained sanguine hopes at this time, in spite of the
bad news received as to the condition of Antwerp, and although such
hopes were never realised I still think they were justified. These
optimistic anticipations <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> were grounded entirely upon the
advance which the Russians were then making through Galicia, and the
splendid fights they had put up in East Prussia and Poland. We
estimated that they were not far from Cracow, and if that fortress
were taken, and the Russians maintained their position, I looked
forward to a great reduction of the German forces opposed to us on the
Western front.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicholas had proved himself to be a commander of high
courage, energy and skill, and we all hoped for great things from his
leadership.</p>

<p>At this time we never had the faintest idea of the actual political
situation in Russia, and knew nothing of the terrible dissensions and
intrigues which were destined to nullify all the magnificent
self-sacrifice displayed by the Russian troops, and to ruin every
attempt made by these great armies of the East to assist and support
the Allied operations.</p>

<p>I feel sure that the British Army officers and men alike will ever
hold these Russian soldiers and their loyal leaders in honour and
grateful memory and admiration. Their prompt invasion of Eastern
Prussia did much to make the victory of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> possible.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, in depending upon our Eastern Allies to
the extent that we subsequently did, we showed as limited a mental
prevision in the "political" as we did in the "military" outlook.</p>

<p>Just as we had failed during the past to read accurately the lessons
as regards the fighting of the future, which modern science and
invention should have taught us, so we had never foreseen how unstable
and unreliable a country must be whose ruler and Government are
absolutely despotic, and in no sense representative of the will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> of the people. Worse than this, the governing classes in
Russia were saturated with disloyalty and intrigue in the most corrupt
form. But for their black treachery the war would have ended
successfully at the latest in the spring of 1917.</p>

<p>How could such a people successfully withstand the strain of so mighty
a clash of arms, especially when the immense foreign loans and the
placing of enormous contracts brought grist to the mills of that
corrupt mass of financiers whose business in life was only to fatten
on the misfortunes of their fellow creatures?</p>

<p>But to proceed with my narrative. Gough's Cavalry Division was moving
up towards the north next day. I saw him and discussed the situation
fully. I explained the desperate nature of the situation at Antwerp
and told him how necessary it was that he should expedite his
movements to the utmost, adding that he must, therefore, avoid being
drawn <span class="italic">en route</span> into any local encounter in which French troops might
be engaged.</p>

<p>The situation will be clearer if I state the actual position of the
troops on the night of 2nd October.</p>

<p>1st Corps and 16th Infantry Brigade and 32nd <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr> Brigade holding
former positions and, in addition, the trenches round <span lang="fr">Vailly</span> formerly
held by 3rd Division.</p>

<p>3rd Corps holding former positions and, in addition, the trenches
round Missy formerly held by the 5th Division.</p>

<p>1st Cavalry Division as before, but 1st Cavalry Brigade holding
trenches covering <span lang="fr">Condé</span> Bridge.</p>

<p>2nd Cavalry Division moved to area
<span lang="fr">Silly-sur-Ourcq&mdash;Hartennes&mdash;Ambrief</span>.</p>

<p>2nd Corps. 3rd Division in area <span lang="fr">Oulchy-le-Château&mdash;Grand Rozoy</span>, with
7th Brigade at <span lang="fr">Cerseuil</span>; two battalions 9th <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> Brigade still in
trenches at <span lang="fr">Vailly</span> to be withdrawn this night (October 2nd).</p>

<p>5th Division in area <span lang="fr">Couvrelles&mdash;Ciry&mdash;Nampteuil-sous-Muret</span>.</p>

<p>On the 3rd, General Sir James Willcocks, commanding the Indian
contingent, arrived and reported himself. Of the Indian troops, one
cavalry regiment (15th Lancers), one brigade of artillery and two
brigades of infantry had reached <span lang="fr">Orleans</span>, which was the Indian advance
base. I fully discussed the situation with him.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written about the work of the Indian troops in
France, and various opinions have been expressed. For my part I can
only say that, from first to last, so long as they were under my
command, they maintained and probably surpassed even the magnificent
traditions of the Indian Army. In a country and climate to which they
were totally unaccustomed, the exigencies of the moment required that
they should be thrown into action successively by smaller or greater
units before they could be properly concentrated.</p>

<p>I shall always gratefully remember the invaluable assistance they and
their Commander, Sir James Willcocks, rendered under these difficult
conditions in the most critical hours of the First Battle of Ypres,
especially the Lahore Division, commanded by General Watkins.</p>

<p>Just after the appearance of the Indian troops in our trenches, we
intercepted a German wireless message sent to the enemy commanders on
the Indians' front, directing them to take prisoner as many unwounded
Indians as possible, to treat them with all possible courtesy and
consideration and send them in to Headquarters. It was a cunning
attempt to undermine the loyalty of the Indian contingents, but it
never met with the slightest success.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> received news on this day that the 21st French Corps had
commenced to detrain 3 miles west of Lille. This Corps formed the left
of the French Army under <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span>, which was concentrating to the
north of <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>, in order to carry on the great attempted
outflanking movement.</p>

<p>The Armies under <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span> and <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span>, with some cavalry
divisions, formed a "group" under the supreme command of General Foch,
who was directed also to exercise general control over all the French
Armies operating in the northern theatre.</p>

<p>No personal record of my share in the war would be satisfactory to me
did it not include special mention of this remarkable man and eminent
soldier. Like his great friend Henry Wilson in England, he was at one
time head of the Staff College in France. Shortly before the war he
paid several visits to England. It was on the occasion of one of these
that I first made his acquaintance. All the world knows the splendid
work he did in the first weeks of the war, and it gave me the greatest
pleasure and satisfaction to find myself so closely associated with
him in the northern theatre. I hope it is not too much to say that,
during this time, our acquaintance ripened into a fast and firm
friendship, which has increased and expanded ever since.</p>

<p>I regard General Foch as one of the finest soldiers and most capable
leaders I have ever known. In appearance he is slight and small of
stature, albeit with a most wiry and active frame. It is in his eyes
and the expression of his face that one sees his extraordinary power.
He appreciates a military situation like lightning, with marvellous
accuracy, and evinces wonderful skill and versatility in dealing with
it. Animated by a consuming energy his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> constant exclamation
"<span class="italic" lang="fr">Attaque! Attaque! Attaque!</span>" reflected his state of mind, and there
can be no doubt that he imbued his troops with much of his spirit. Of
all the generals in this great struggle he most resembled in audacious
strategy his great master&mdash;Napoleon.</p>

<p>Personally I owe a great deal to his invaluable help and cordial
co-operation. In the darkest hours of our work together&mdash;and there
were many such&mdash;I never knew him anything but what I have
described&mdash;bold, hopeful, and cheery; but ever vigilant, wary, and
full of resource.</p>

<p>Several local attacks were delivered against the 1st Corps which were
repulsed with loss, and I saw little reason to fear that the temporary
weakening of our line would have any ill-effects.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division was now also <span class="italic">en route</span> for the northern
theatre.</p>

<p>On the 5th reports had reached me from Bridges, in Antwerp. He was
certainly pessimistic as to the possibility of the fortress holding
out until we could relieve it. He told me that the Germans had 16-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>
howitzers in position against the forts.</p>

<p>There were indications to-day that considerable German forces were
collecting against <span lang="fr">Foch</span>'s left, near <span lang="fr">Lille</span>, and the flanking movement
was making very little progress. German cavalry were reported to be in
Hazebrouck.</p>

<p>At <span lang="fr">Fère-en-Tardenois</span> I received a visit from President <span lang="fr">Poincaré</span>. He
thanked me for all the work the British Army had done in France, and
spoke a great deal about the situation at Antwerp. He told me he
thought the action of the British War Office in sending troops into
Antwerp was a mistake, and expressed great surprise that the control
and direction of all the British troops in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span> France was not
left entirely in the hands of one Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>On the 8th, General Headquarters moved to <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span>, at which place
the 2nd Corps had nearly completed their detrainment. They were
concentrating north-east of <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span>, and their leading troops were
on the line <span lang="fr">Oneux&mdash;Nouvion-en-Ponthieu</span>.</p>

<p>The 3rd Corps had been relieved on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> by French troops, and
their entrainment at <span lang="fr">Compiègne</span> was proceeding.</p>

<p>We left <span lang="fr">Fère-en-Tardenois</span> at 8.30 on the morning of the 8th, and
reached General <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>'s Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Breteuil</span> about one. He
told me that his 4th Corps was again being very hard pressed, and that
the enemy was attacking violently all along his front. The General had
just heard that two of his sons had been killed in action, and was
naturally in a very sad and depressed frame of mind.</p>

<p>I then went on to General Foch's Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Doullens</span>, which I
reached about four in the afternoon. He gave me a great reception with
a guard of honour.</p>

<p>He took a very optimistic view of the situation, said that the enemy
was making no headway anywhere, and that he was gradually getting
round the German flank on the north. It gave me a great hope for the
future to find him so confident of success.</p>

<p>I explained my plans to him briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The 2nd Corps, having completed its detrainment north of <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span>,
was to march to the line <span lang="fr">Aire&mdash;Béthune</span>. The Corps should arrive there
on the 11th; the 3rd Corps was to detrain at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> about the 12th;
the cavalry was to move in advance of the 2nd Corps to sweep round by
the front and northern flank to clear the ground.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> returned to <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span> that evening. I found that an officer
had arrived from Ostend by motor with a letter from Rawlinson, in
which he explained the situation in the north, the details of which we
know.</p>

<p>I remained at <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span> and its neighbourhood on the 9th.</p>

<p>The British move to the north was now in full swing. <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span> is an
important railway junction, and as I looked down from some high ground
commanding a view of all the lines of railway, it was as though every
set of metals had its procession of trains as far as the eye could
reach. That a flank movement of some magnitude was proceeding must
have been apparent to any observer. Some enemy aircraft flew over the
ground on which I stood, and I felt sure that the Germans must have
had warning of our approach to the north. But if the movement was ever
properly reported, very little attention was paid to it, for the
subsequent activities of the cavalry and the 3rd Corps were most
certainly a surprise to the enemy.</p>

<p>Spiers, too, came in and told me that the left of Foch's Army (<span lang="fr">de
Maud'huy</span>'s Corps) was holding its own well.</p>

<p>That day I had a long interview with Allenby, and arranged with him to
form the cavalry into two divisions, the 1st under de Lisle, the 2nd
under Gough. The two, forming the Cavalry Corps, to be, of course,
under Allenby's command. I directed him to make <span lang="fr">Aire</span> by the 10th with
the 2nd Cavalry Division, the 1st to follow in support.</p>

<p>I told him that his <span class="italic">rôle</span> in the immediate future would be to clear
the country to the north and north-east, reconnoitring woods, etc.,
and securing passages over waterways. I warned him that he must be
prepared to turn round and support the 2nd Corps if it became
necessary, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> but added that I hoped not to have to call upon
him for this.</p>

<p>An air officer (not, however, Sykes) whom I had sent towards Antwerp
returned and reported the fall of the fortress. He told me of the
great difficulty which had been experienced in withdrawing the Naval
Brigade.</p>

<p>On this afternoon (October 9th) I had a message from Rawlinson. He
told me that 8,000 French were holding Ghent. He was sending two
brigades under Capper to the place in order to cover the retreat of
the Belgians to Bruges, and, with the same object, he was directing a
brigade of Byng's cavalry on the <span lang="fr">Lys</span> towards <span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>.</p>

<p>A wire having arrived from Kitchener putting Rawlinson under my
command, I sent the latter instructions.</p>

<p>He was told to hold the line of the Lys if he could, but not to risk a
big fight. If he could hold on to these positions I promised to
connect up with him by the 13th or 14th. If, however, he were forced
to retire, he was directed to do so in the direction of <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>,
where the 3rd Corps was now detraining.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 9th, the 2nd Corps were approaching the line
<span lang="fr">Béthune&mdash;Aire</span>, the infantry travelling in motor lorries lent by
General Foch. These lorries and motor omnibuses were much used in the
ensuing operations, and proved of great value in adding to the
mobility of the troops.</p>

<p>On the 10th, orders were sent to Rawlinson to the effect that the
troops under his command (namely, the 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry
Division) were to form the 4th Corps, and that, as soon as the 8th
Division came out it would go to him, and Byng's cavalry would be
withdrawn.</p>

<p>I was much perturbed at hearing that there was delay on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> the
part of the French in relieving the 1st Corps on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>; <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>,
however, assured me that all Haig's troops should reach <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> so as
to enable me to get them into line by the 17th or the 19th, and with
this I had to be content.</p>

<p>When I visited Smith-Dorrien at his Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Hesdin</span>, I found
that he would not be able to reach the line assigned to him on this
night, as the motor lorries were late, and his mounted troops and
horses were very tired. I directed him to rest for the night and march
at 9 a.m. next morning.</p>

<p>After leaving the 2nd Corps I went to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pol and had a long talk with
General <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span> (commanding the 10th Army). I learnt from him that
things were not going so well north of Loos. He had been obliged to
fall back before the attack of the <abbr title="19">XIX</abbr>th German Corps, which had come
up from <span lang="fr">Valenciennes</span>. He expected to be forced further west, but
promised me to hold a line extending from <span lang="fr">Béthune</span> to the south-east up
to 12 noon on the 12th, if by then the 2nd Corps could have arrived at
<span lang="fr">Béthune</span>.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">De Maud'huy</span> was among the best Army Commanders that France had
produced in the war. I look back with much pleasure and gratification
to my long association with him. He was of a most cheerful and buoyant
temperament and a <span class="italic" lang="fr">bon camarade</span> in every sense of the word. His skill
and dash as a leader are well known.</p>

<p>On leaving him I returned again to Smith-Dorrien, and begged him to
hasten his move. He promised to deploy into his new position as early
as possible on the following morning.</p>

<p>On this day (October 10th) instructions were sent to Allenby to take
the 1st Cavalry Division to join the 2nd near <span lang="fr">Aire</span> early the next day,
and to act on the left front and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> flank of the 2nd Corps. The
<span lang="fr">Forêt de Nieppe</span> was said to be occupied by German cavalry in some
strength.</p>

<p>After a long interview with Foch, we concerted together plans of which
the following is a brief outline.</p>

<p>It was agreed that, by the 13th, the British and French troops would
be in a position to make a combined advance east. On that day we were
to make the line <span lang="fr">Lille&mdash;Courtrai</span>.</p>

<p>The French left was to secure the passage of the Scheldt at Lille; the
British centre was to be directed on <span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>, and was to make good
the passage of the Lys at that place.</p>

<p>The road <span lang="fr">Béthune&mdash;Lille&mdash;Tournai</span> was to be used by the French, and all
roads north of it by the British.</p>

<p>The 4th Corps and Belgians were to be on the left of the advance.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th the cavalry had cleared the <span lang="fr">Forêt de Nieppe</span>
(south of Hazebrouck), and were in touch with the Divisional Cavalry
of the 6th Division east of that place. They extended thence
south-east to the left of the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>The 2nd Corps had reached the line of the canal, and I directed
Smith-Dorrien to wheel up his left the next morning in the direction
of <span lang="fr">Merville</span> and move east to the line <span lang="fr">Laventie&mdash;Lorgies</span>, which would
bring him on the immediate left of the French 10th Army.</p>

<p>One division of the 3rd Corps was moving on Hazebrouck.</p>

<p>Rawlinson reported that Capper with two brigades was still in Ghent.
His aircraft had brought word that two divisions of the enemy were
moving on <span lang="fr">Alost&mdash;Termonde&mdash;Lokeren</span>, and that five pontoon bridges had
been constructed by the Germans at <span lang="fr">Termonde</span>. He said he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> had
received my instructions and would carry them out as far as he was
able to.</p>

<p>The 3rd Cavalry Division was at <span lang="fr">Thourout</span>.</p>

<p>The French cavalry were very energetic on the 11th. Conneau's Cavalry
Corps pushed back the German cavalry to the line
<span lang="fr">Vermelles&mdash;Richebourg&mdash;Vieille Chapelle</span>. De Mitry's Cavalry Corps
assembled and drove the German cavalry back to the line of the Lawe at
<span lang="fr">Vieille Chapelle</span> and <span lang="fr">Estaires</span>.</p>

<p>By the night of the 11th, the Cavalry Corps under Allenby had made
good a great deal of ground to the north, and were halting between
Wallon-Cappel (west of Hazebrouck) and <span lang="fr">Merville</span>. Moving thence on the
morning of the 12th, they carried out invaluable work during the
subsequent two or three days. Allenby liberally interpreted his orders
and made a magnificent sweep to the north and north-east, driving the
enemy back all the way.</p>

<p>Of all the splendid work performed by the cavalry during the war,
little can compare (in results achieved) with this advance. It was
only surpassed by their immortal stand on the Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span>
ridge on those ever-memorable days and nights of October 31st and
November 1st.</p>

<p>By the evening of the 12th, Gough, with the 2nd Cavalry Division, had
attacked and captured the Mont des Cats position, which was a
strategic point of great importance lying six miles north-east of
Hazebrouck. There was great opposition by the enemy cavalry, which was
supported by <span lang="de">jäger</span> and strong infantry detachments; but Gough carried
all before him in fine style.</p>

<p>The 1st Division under <span lang="fr">de Lisle</span> halted before <span lang="fr">Merris</span>, after severe
fighting which drove the enemy back many miles.</p>

<p>On <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> the 13th, the cavalry made a further great advance,
driving the enemy before them, and on the evening reached the line
<span lang="fr">Mont Noir&mdash;Boeschepe&mdash;Berthen</span>. The position of <span lang="fr">Mont Noir</span> was
vigorously defended by the Germans, but they were finally driven out
by the 2nd Cavalry Division under Gough, who handled his troops with
great skill and determination.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the 1st Cavalry Division reached the area
<span lang="fr">Dranoutre&mdash;Messines</span> and pushed advanced detachments to <span lang="fr">Warneton</span>. The
2nd Division moved to the <span lang="fr">Kemmel</span>&mdash;Wytschaete area, sending advanced
detachments to Werwick.</p>

<p>I sent instructions to Allenby to make a strong reconnaissance of the
<span lang="fr">Lys</span> from <span lang="fr">Estaires</span> to <span lang="fr">Menin</span> on the 15th, and report the result as
quickly as possible to me at the Headquarters of the 3rd Corps.</p>

<p>Late at night on the 12th, the 3rd Corps (4th and 6th Divisions and
19th Brigade) moved to the area east and south of Hazebrouck. The
infantry were moved in motor omnibuses.</p>

<p>On this day General Headquarters were moved from <span lang="fr">Abbeville</span> to <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Omer</span>. On my way there I went to Hazebrouck to see the Commander of the
3rd Corps. Pulteney is a very old friend and comrade of mine, to whom
I should like to devote a few lines of this story.</p>

<p>The keenest of soldiers from his early youth, he was Adjutant of his
battalion of the Scots Guards. Thence he sought service in Africa,
where he did excellent work, although he suffered severely from the
climate.</p>

<p>I had the good fortune to be closely associated with him in the South
African War, and there had experience of his fine qualities as a
soldier and leader of men. I was delighted to find him with me as one
of the three Corps Commanders <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> who fought with the First
Expeditionary Force sent to France.</p>

<p>Throughout my period of Commander-in-Chief he wholly justified the
estimate which I had formed of his capacity and capability in the
field. He enjoyed the full confidence of the officers and men who
served under him. Possessed of iron nerve and indomitable courage, he
remained imperturbable and unmoved in face of the most difficult and
precarious situations. No matter how arduous the task imposed upon him
he never made difficulties, but always carried out the <span class="italic">rôle</span> assigned
to him with energy and skill. It had been my hope to see him in
command of an Army, for which I feel sure he was thoroughly qualified;
but my withdrawal from France prevented my carrying out my intentions
with regard to him.</p>

<p>His conduct of the operations which I am just about to describe was
characterised by his customary skill, boldness and decision. The great
results which accrued from the First Battle of Ypres may be fairly
traced back to his initial leading of the 3rd Corps in the series of
successful advances which were the most prominent and important
amongst the opening phases of that great combat.</p>

<p>On reaching Hazebrouck, about 4 p.m. on the 13th, I was told that the
3rd Corps was engaged with the enemy some miles east of the town.
Repairing with all speed in that direction I came up with the rear of
the 6th Division, which had been heavily engaged almost up to that
moment, but now was preparing to advance. My car got hopelessly
blocked amidst ammunition wagons and all manner of traffic, and in
trying to extricate it we found ourselves badly bogged in a ploughed
field.</p>

<p>Leaving the motor to struggle back, I tried to see what was going on
from some high ground close by. Rain was falling <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> heavily,
and the atmosphere was foggy and misty. I watched as best I could for
some little time what was going forward, until I felt assured that the
tide of battle was flowing very favourably for us. I then got back as
quickly as possible to Headquarters at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>, where reports were
awaiting me. I learnt that the town had been heavily bombed by hostile
aircraft during the day. Much damage was done to buildings, and
several soldiers and civilians had been killed and wounded. It was a
somewhat unpleasant welcome for us, but the effect of it was
completely wiped out by the news I received from Pulteney of the
victory he had attained.</p>

<p>The enemy opposed to him consisted of one or two Divisions of cavalry,
at least a Division of infantry (19th Corps) and several <span lang="de">jäger</span>
battalions. Pulteney found them posted in a strong position covering
<span lang="fr">Bailleul</span>, with their left resting on <span lang="fr">Bleu</span> (close to <span lang="fr">Vieux Berquin</span>) and
their right on <span lang="fr">Berthen</span>. The British attack opened at 1.30 p.m., and by
nightfall the 6th Division had captured <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span> and Meteren, whilst
the 4th Division captured and occupied a strong position facing east
one mile to the north of the 6th Division.</p>

<p>This was an excellent day's work performed by the 3rd Corps; and the
captured ground was of great value in the subsequent operations.</p>

<p>About noon on the 14th, the 3rd Corps continued the advance, and after
some considerable fighting secured, by 7 p.m., the line <span lang="fr">Bleu</span>&mdash;east of
<span lang="fr">Bailleul&mdash;Neuve Église</span>.</p>

<p>On the 15th I directed Pulteney to make good the River <span lang="fr">Lys</span> between
<span lang="fr">Armentières</span> and <span lang="fr">Sailly-sur-la-Lys</span>, and endeavour to gain touch with
the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>By nightfall the 3rd Corps had made the line <span lang="fr">Sailly-Nieppe</span>.</p>

<p>Between <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> the 11th and the 15th, the 4th Corps under Rawlinson
was constantly engaged in assisting and covering the retreat of the
Belgian Army. During this time the German forces from Antwerp were
concentrating westwards in ever-increasing strength. The 7th Division
under Capper retired successively from Ghent to Aeltre, thence to
<span lang="fr">Thielt</span>, from <span lang="fr">Thielt</span> to <span lang="fr">Roulers</span>, and from <span lang="fr">Roulers</span> to the south and east
of <span lang="fr">Ypres</span>.</p>

<p>The 3rd Cavalry Division under Byng was at <span lang="fr">Thourout</span> on the 11th, at
<span lang="fr">Roulers</span> on the 12th, at Ypres on the 13th, and on the 14th connected
up with Gough's 2nd Cavalry Division in front of Kemmel, which
position the two Cavalry Divisions captured and secured.</p>

<p>On the 15th the 7th Division was east of <span lang="fr">Ypres</span>, with the 3rd Cavalry
Division well out in advance of them in the direction of <span lang="fr">Menin</span> and
<span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>.</p>

<p>The capture of the high ground about Kemmel proved to be of the utmost
importance to us throughout the Battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>On the 12th the Belgian Army assembled in the area
Ostend&mdash;Dixmude&mdash;Furnes&mdash;Nieuport, but on the 15th withdrew entirely
behind the Yser to the north of Ypres.</p>

<p>The French Naval Division and other troops which had been covering the
Belgian retreat were at Dixmude and Nieuport. A French Territorial
Division from <span lang="fr">Cassel</span> had been moved to Ypres.</p>

<p>On the 14th it was reported that about 10,000 German troops from
Antwerp were moving on Bruges and <span lang="fr">Roulers</span>, and that another German
Division from Antwerp had reached <span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>.</p>

<p>On the 15th, the enemy strengthened their line on the Lys, where part
of the 19th and 12th German Corps were reported to be with their right
on <span lang="fr">Menin</span>, and, finally, the Germans <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> were said to be
advancing in four columns to the line <span lang="fr">Ghistelles&mdash;Roulers</span>.</p>

<p>I now turn to the operations of the 2nd Corps, which, it will be
remembered, was on the right of the British forces to the east of
<span lang="fr">Béthune</span>.</p>

<p>I visited Smith-Dorrien at his Headquarters almost every day between
the 11th and the 15th. On each occasion I was more and more impressed
by the exceptionally difficult nature of the country in this part of
our field of operations.</p>

<p>If we draw a line on the map starting from Lens on the south and
following north through <span lang="fr">Liévin, La Bassée, Fromelles, Armentières</span>,
almost to the valley of the River <span lang="fr">Douve</span> on the north, the whole
<span class="italic" lang="fr">terrain</span> for several miles to the east and west of that line strongly
resembles the English Black Country. North of <span lang="fr">Liévin</span> the ground is
very flat, whilst mining works, slag heaps, factories and mining
villages completely cover the surface in all directions.</p>

<p>There is a large mining population whose tenements (sometimes single
houses, sometimes separate rows or cottages) cover the whole area.
There are also towns of some size, such as <span lang="fr">Béthune, Noeux-les-Mines,
Nieppe</span>, and <span lang="fr">Armentières</span>.</p>

<p>The ground, moreover, was of such a character as to render effective
artillery support to an infantry attack most difficult. The roads were
rough, narrow, badly paved, and very slippery in wet weather, which
caused movements by motor to be a work of time and difficulty,
particularly in the case of the heavy motor transport passing between
the troops and their supply depôts. This marked defect in the roads
applied, however, to the whole area over which the British operations
extended.</p>

<p>After <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> some severe fighting, particularly by the 5th Division,
the 2nd Corps reached the line <span lang="fr">Annequin&mdash;Pont Fixe&mdash;Festubert&mdash;Vieille
Chapelle&mdash;Fosse</span> on the night of the 12th.</p>

<p>On my way to Hazebrouck on the 13th, I saw Smith-Dorrien for a short
time. He was holding his own, and during the day his left (3rd
Division) made good progress, reaching <span lang="fr">Pont du Hem</span> close to <span lang="fr">Laventie</span>.</p>

<p>The French cavalry, which had been operating in advance of the 2nd
Corps, had drawn back to the northern flank of the latter and were at
<span lang="fr">Pont Rigneul</span>. For some days subsequently they held the ground and kept
up connection between our 2nd and 3rd Corps.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, I again visited Smith-Dorrien at
<span lang="fr">Béthune</span>. He was in one of those fits of deep depression which
unfortunately visited him frequently. He complained that the 2nd Corps
had never got over what he described as the "shock" of <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span>, and
that the officers sent out to him to replace his tremendous losses in
officers were untrained and inexperienced; and, lastly, he expressed
himself convinced that there was no great fighting spirit throughout
the troops he commanded.</p>

<p>I told him that I thought he greatly exaggerated these disabilities. I
pointed out that the cavalry, the 4th Division and the 19th Brigade
were all just as heavily engaged at <span lang="fr">Le Cateau</span> as the 2nd Corps, but
that their spirit and condition, as I had seen for myself the day
before, were excellent.</p>

<p>Even if, as I consider, his point of view was needlessly pessimistic,
Smith-Dorrien was certainly confronted with a difficult task. He was
on a very extended front, and the situation undoubtedly demanded
skilful handling and great determination.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> arranged with Foch that the French should extend their line
north, up to the line of the <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> canal. When this was done, the
Commander of the 2nd Corps was able to shorten his line and keep one
of his brigades back in reserve.</p>

<p>On this day General Hubert Hamilton, commanding the 3rd Division, was
killed by a shell. His loss was deeply felt by his Division, who had
the utmost confidence in him.</p>

<p>Hubert Hamilton was an old friend of mine, and it grieved me much to
lose him. He was a fine soldier, possessing a most attractive nature,
and I do not think he can have had an enemy in the world. I have
always looked back with admiration to his leading of the 3rd Division
in that critical period of the war.</p>

<p>I conclude this chapter with the arrival of the last detachment of the
1st Corps at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> from the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>. There to the last they
maintained the fine fighting record which they had earned, for on the
11th&mdash;shortly before their departure&mdash;they once again gallantly
repulsed a heavy German attack with great loss to the enemy.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th, the 2nd Division and 16th Brigade had been
withdrawn from the trenches and had begun entraining <span class="italic">en route</span> for
<span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>, being followed shortly by the remainder of the 1st Corps.</p>

<p>The following Order of the Day was issued to the troops on October
16th:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Special Order of the Day.</span></p>

<p><span class="left50">"General Headquarters,</span><br>
<span class="left60">"October 16th, 1914.</span></p>

<p>"1. Having for 25 days successfully held the line of the River <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>
between <span lang="fr">Soissons</span> and <span lang="fr">Villers</span> against the most desperate endeavours of
the enemy to break through, that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> memorable battle has now
been brought to a conclusion, so far as the British Forces are
concerned, by the operation which has once more placed us on the left
flank of the Allied Armies.</p>

<p>"2. At the close of this important phase of the campaign, I wish to
express my heartfelt appreciation of the services performed throughout
this trying period by the officers, non-commissioned officers and men
of the British Field Forces in France.</p>

<p>"3. Throughout nearly the whole of those 25 days a most powerful and
continuous fire of artillery, from guns of a calibre never used before
in field operations, covered and supported desperate infantry attacks
made in the greatest strength and directed at all hours of the day and
night on your positions.</p>

<p>"Although you were thus denied adequate rest and suffered great
losses, in no case did the enemy attain the slightest success, but was
invariably thrown back with immense loss.</p>

<p>"4. The powerful endurance of the troops was further greatly taxed by
the cold and wet weather which prevailed during the greater part of
the time.</p>

<p>"5. Paragraph 2 of the Special Order of the Day, August 22nd, ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left10">"'All the regiments comprising the Expeditionary Force bear on
     their colours emblems and names which constantly remind them of
     glorious victories achieved by them in the past. I have the most
     complete confidence that those regiments, as they stand to-day in
     close proximity to the enemy, will not only uphold the
     magnificent traditions of former days, but will add fresh laurels
     to their standards.'</p>

<p>"I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> cannot convey what I feel with regard to the conduct of
the troops under my command better than by expressing my conviction
that they have justified that confidence well and nobly.</p>

<p>"6. That confidence is everywhere endorsed by their fellow-countrymen;
and, whatever may be before the British Army in France, I am sure they
will continue to follow the same, glorious path till final and
complete victory is attained.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="10">X</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF YPRES</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="italic">First Phase, October 15th to October 26th</span></p>


<p>Before continuing my narrative, which has now reached the opening
stages of the First Battle of Ypres, let us consider what were the
points at issue in this grave crisis in the history of the world. What
were the stakes for which we were playing?</p>

<p>Let us suppose that from October 1914 up to the end of the war, the
German right flank had been established at <span lang="fr">Dieppe</span>, instead of at
Nieuport. The enemy would have been in occupation of the whole of the
Department of the <span lang="fr">Pas de Calais</span>, including the seaports of <span lang="fr">Dieppe,
Boulogne, Calais</span> and Dunkirk.</p>

<p>How then would it have fared with the British Empire?</p>

<p>Discussing the question of the Channel tunnel, at a meeting of the
Council of Imperial Defence, in May 1914, I suggested the possibility
of submarines being despatched in sections by rail to certain ports
and there assembled. The expert reply was that this would be quite
impracticable. How has the experience of the war borne out this
dictum?</p>

<p>It is as certain as anything can be, that, in the circumstances I have
supposed, the Channel ports would soon have been full to overflowing
with these craft, which, with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> such bases of operations,
would have rendered the Channel a veritable <span class="italic">mare clausum</span>, so far as
any attempt by our Navy to prevent invasion were concerned.</p>

<p>If, then, Napoleon entertained high hopes of success when he
concentrated an army at <span lang="fr">Boulogne</span> in 1805 for the invasion of this
country, surely the Germans, in such circumstances as I have
described, would have regarded such an enterprise with still greater
confidence. And they would have been justified in so doing.</p>

<p>Then, as to aircraft. An examination of the map will show that London
would be within about half the aircraft range of the German aerodromes
as they existed if these latter were moved to Calais and its
neighbourhood. Let those who have had experience of the full effect of
air raids on London during the war judge what this might have meant.
Had the western Channel ports been in German occupation, the horrors
of these air raids would have been multiplied a hundredfold.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add that, during the war, heavy artillery
succeeded in making effective practice at ranges greater than the
distance between Calais and Dover.</p>

<p>I think it is reasonable to deduce from this argument that the stakes
for which we were playing at the great Battle of Ypres were nothing
less than the safety, indeed, the very existence, of the British
Empire.</p>

<p>Now, the Germans had two distinct opportunities of bringing about such
a situation as I have contemplated&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>(1) To reinforce their right much sooner than they did&mdash;even
     though, by so doing, they had to make slight and unimportant
     sacrifices elsewhere&mdash;and to take up a line of entrenchments
     resting on the sea at <span lang="fr">Dieppe</span>, whence they could have run their
     trenches east and joined up with their main line before <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span>
     <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>'s flank movement could possibly have developed.</p>

<p>(2) By successfully attacking the British and French forces to
     the east of Ypres, and driving them back to the sea.</p>
</div>

<p>This latter alternative, as we know, is what they actually attempted;
which mighty effort, together with our successful and prolonged
resistance, constituted the First Battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>No one who has done me the honour of reading this book so far can
suppose that I did not realise this danger.</p>

<p>I am free to confess, however, that, on October 15th, 1914, the day
upon which I date the opening of the Battle of Ypres, I thought that
the danger was past. I believed that the enemy had exhausted his
strength in the great bid he had made to smash our armies on the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>
and to capture Paris. The fine successes gained by the cavalry and the
3rd Corps, narrated in the last chapter, did much to confirm these
impressions on my mind.</p>

<p>I could not bring myself to suppose for one moment that, with such
resources as the Germans afterwards showed that they had at this time
in reserve, they could have let slip such an opportunity as we
afforded them by our long delay on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> and our perilous
disregard of the danger in the north. One of their punishments will be
the corroding contemplation of the "ifs" and "buts" of their
stupendous gamble.</p>

<p>In my inmost heart, I did not expect I should have to fight a great
defensive battle. All my dispositions were made with the idea of
carrying out effectively the combined offensive which, as narrated in
the last chapter, was concerted between Foch and myself.</p>

<p>There was only one reservation in my mind, and that concerned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> the danger of leaving a gap anywhere in our long line, or of
failing to give a sufficiently close support to the weary but most
gallant Army of the King of the Belgians. As will presently be shown,
I had to run a terrible risk to safeguard against this danger, but I
hold that the risk was justified.</p>

<p>Many of Napoleon's great campaigns developed in a totally unexpected
manner, quite different to his original conception, but he always
claimed that his constant success was due to the initial correct
direction and impulse which he always imparted to his armies. Tolstoy
states that the only directions he gave at Borodino, three in number,
were never carried out, and could never, as the battle developed, have
been carried out. I have not verified the great Russian novelist's
statement, but it may well be true. History relates that in the Jena
campaign of 1806, Napoleon, in three days, made three erroneous
calculations of the Prussians' doings.</p>

<p>"On the 10th," says Hamley, in his "Operations of War," "he thought
Hohenlohe was about to attack him; on the 10th also he judged that the
Prussians were concentrating on Gera; and on the 13th he mistook
Hohenlohe's army for the entire Prussian force. Still, his plan, made
on these suppositions, was in the main quite suitable to the actual
circumstances. And this, as is mostly the case, was owing <span class="italic">to the
right direction</span> given to the movements <span class="italic">at the outset</span>. The
preliminary conditions of a campaign seldom offer more than three or
four alternatives; an attack by the centre or either flank, or some
combination of these. If the enemy has made such false dispositions as
to render one of these alternatives decidedly the best, the General
who has the faculty of choosing it thereby provides in the best
possible way for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> all subsequent contingencies. <span class="italic">A right
impulse</span> once given to an army, it is in a position to turn events not
calculated on, or miscalculated, to advantage."</p>

<p>As a humble but life-long disciple of this great master of war, I
venture to make the same claim for the operations now about to be
discussed.</p>

<p>The designation of the place where any great battle has taken place,
and the limits of time within which it has lasted, were formerly much
more easily defined than now.</p>

<p>In my first dispatch reporting the details of the Battle of Ypres, I
think it was described as "The Battle of <span lang="fr">Ypres-Armentières</span>," and,
strictly speaking, that really would have been more correct.</p>

<p>I have mentioned this in order to draw attention to the fact that,
although the most critical point throughout this living line of battle
was east of the town of Ypres, yet the battle which was given that
name was fought on a front of many miles, extending from the sea at
Nieuport to the <span lang="fr">Béthune&mdash;Lille</span> canal. Continuous and heavy fighting
went on for days all along this line.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the operations which I am about to narrate, my
plans were based generally on the agreement which I had come to with
Foch on the 10th instant. Nothing had occurred, so far, to raise any
great doubts in my mind as to the possibility of prosecuting the
offensive which we had arranged to put in movement. At the time of the
arrival of the 1st Corps, a few days later, increasing opposition had
made itself felt all along the Allied front in the north, and reports
reached us of a powerful offensive by the enemy towards Ypres and the
Yser. In consequence of this, my appreciation of the situation was
that I should have to make a very momentous decision between two most
perilous alternatives.</p>

<p>But, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> for the moment, at any rate, I felt complete confidence.
I met the Corps Commanders at Hazebrouck, and, in accordance with the
plans which Foch and I had agreed upon, directed them as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>The 2nd Corps on the right was ordered to continue in its present
direction, making ground to the east.</p>

<p>The 3rd Corps was to advance and make good the River <span lang="fr">Lys</span> between
<span lang="fr">Armentières</span> and <span lang="fr">Sailly-sur-Lys</span>, and to endeavour to gain touch with
the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>The cavalry under Allenby were to make good the river towards <span lang="fr">Menin</span>,
and then, if possible, sweep round to the north and north-east.</p>

<p>Rawlinson was to move with his right on <span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>, keeping generally
level with the 3rd Corps in the subsequent advance, should that prove
possible; his cavalry under Byng were to move to the north of him.</p>
</div>

<p>I had told Rawlinson that, whilst conforming to the general move east,
he must keep an eye on the enemy's detachments known to be at Bruges
and <span lang="fr">Roulers</span>. I told him I would deal with these later by means of the
1st Corps, but for the moment his left required careful watching.</p>

<p>In carrying out these orders some progress was made, and the troops
reached the following lines by midnight:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>2nd Corps.&mdash;<span lang="fr">Givenchy-les-La Bassée&mdash;Pont du Hem</span>.</li>
<li>3rd Corps.&mdash;Neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">Sailly</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining parts of the line were much in the same position as
before.</p>

<p>On the 16th I went out to see the cavalry. The day was wet and misty,
and it was almost impossible to get artillery targets.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions fought all day to gain the
passage of the <span lang="fr">Lys</span> from <span lang="fr">Warneton</span> to <span lang="fr">Comines</span>, but without success.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Division gained a footing in <span lang="fr">Warneton</span>, but was
counter-attacked and driven out in the evening. Before I left Allenby,
he told me he had great hopes of succeeding the next day. I remember
watching some of this fighting from an artillery observation post
established in a very roughly constructed hay-loft, through the rotten
floor of which we were nearly precipitated some twenty feet to the
ground.</p>

<p>On my way back I came to the Headquarters of the 3rd Corps. They were
getting on fairly well and had made some progress, but they had not
yet taken <span lang="fr">Armentières</span>.</p>

<p>On this day the 2nd Corps was able to move forward with slight
opposition to the line <span lang="fr">Givenchy</span>&mdash;north-west of <span lang="fr">Aubers</span>.</p>

<p>Of the 4th Corps, the 7th Division occupied the line
Houthem-Gheluvelt-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julien, in touch with German outposts.</p>

<p>The 3rd Cavalry Division moved towards <span lang="fr">Roulers</span>, and was slightly
engaged with the enemy in the forest of Houthulst. In the evening they
occupied the line Zonnebeke-Westroosebeke.</p>

<p>Reports pointed to an increasing hostile advance centred on <span lang="fr">Thourout</span>.</p>

<p>My ideas as to an earnest offensive on our part were so far modified
by what I had seen and heard, that I sent Wilson to Foch expressing my
conviction that we could not hope to advance east on the lines which
we had discussed on the 10th until our left was cleared. An offensive
on that flank was the only move open to us. This, if <span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span>
successful, would drive the enemy back from Bruges, and possibly clear
Ghent. I was anxious to know what support Foch could give me in the
north. I told Wilson to assure Foch that the 2nd and 3rd Corps, as
well as the cavalry, would continue their endeavour to make headway
east, so far as circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>Foch replied that he had already two Territorial Divisions and two
Cavalry Divisions, besides some six to seven thousand Marines, on the
Yser. He could have another Regular Division there either by the 22nd
or the 23rd, and he would then advance with all the forces at his
disposal, in support of my left, and clear the country as far as
Ostend and Bruges.</p>

<p>By the night of the 18th the 3rd Corps had captured <span lang="fr">Bois Grenier</span> and
<span lang="fr">Armentières</span>, and were on the line <span lang="fr">Radinghem&mdash;Prémesques&mdash;Houplines</span>,
after an excellent advance for which Pulteney deserved great credit.</p>

<p>On the left of the 2nd Corps the 3rd Division had made some advance to
the line <span lang="fr">Lorgies&mdash;Herlies</span>. The 5th Division on the right was up
against <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span>, but could make no further headway. It was a most
formidable stronghold.</p>

<p>The cavalry were watching the River Lys to <span lang="fr">Menin</span>.</p>

<p>As to the 4th Corps, doubtless Rawlinson was restricted by the warning
I had given him, and was naturally somewhat anxious about his left
flank. His troops made but little progress towards the objective
assigned to them.</p>

<p>I had good reasons to think that <span lang="fr">Menin</span> was very weakly occupied on the
17th, and orders were sent to Rawlinson to move on and attack that
place on the 18th. He did not, however, march. The embargo I had laid
upon him as to his left flank was, perhaps, a sufficient
justification; but I have always regretted that the cavalry <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span>
did not get this very necessary support on the 18th, which might
possibly have secured to us the line of the Lys from <span lang="fr">Menin</span> upwards.</p>

<p>I do not impute blame for this to the commander of the 4th Corps. Such
instances of disregard of orders occur in every campaign. Only when
the full history of the war is known, and all the cards are laid on
the table, can a right judgment be formed.</p>

<p>Nothing impressed me so much with the increasing power and weight of
the enemy's opposition as my own personal experience on the afternoon
of the 18th, when I went into <span lang="fr">Armentières</span> to try and study the
situation with a view to estimating future possibilities. A good
outlook was afforded from some high buildings on the eastern edge of
this place. The town was being heavily shelled, and the way in which
large buildings were being smashed and turned into ruins proved that
projectiles of large calibre were falling, and that a considerable
force of <span class="italic">heavy artillery</span> was, therefore, in action against the town.
It was evident that powerful reinforcements were coming up to the
enemy.</p>

<p>I recall this afternoon in <span lang="fr">Armentières</span> very vividly. <span lang="fr">Armentières</span> has a
manufacturing population, and the day being Sunday, everyone was
wearing his best clothes. The scenes in the streets were
extraordinary. Some of the men seemed to have gone mad with either
rage or fear. Women rushed to and fro, screaming, with babies in their
arms.</p>

<p>Close to the look-out post where I was standing, a priest in his altar
vestments dashed out of a church with the sacred vessels in his arms,
and tore in panic down the street in front of me, followed by large
numbers of his flock. A great deal of damage was done to the town, and
there were many casualties amongst the civilians.</p>

<p>By <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> October 19th, the 1st Corps under Haig was fully
concentrated in the northern theatre.</p>

<p>The 2nd Division was in the area Poperinghe&mdash;Boeschepe&mdash;Steenvoorde,
the 1st Division between <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> and <span lang="fr">Cassel</span>.</p>

<p>On this day I had to take a very grave decision, and I shall try and
recall the working of my mind at the time, and the manner in which the
problem I had to solve presented itself to me.</p>

<p>On October 10th and 11th, when I commenced operations in the northern
theatre with the British Forces, I was, as I have said, decidedly
optimistic as to the possibility of carrying out a strong offensive
eastwards. Foch was equally confident, and we both thought that our
concerted plans promised well.</p>

<p>My reason for forming this opinion was, in the first place, based upon
my talks with Foch, who had already been on the spot for several days.
He had been able to form some estimate of the enemy's strength between
<span lang="fr">Arras</span> and the sea. He considered that the Germans were in no condition
to stem a determined advance by us. Reports had reached me of large
transfers of German troops from this theatre to the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> and south of
that river. Foch expressed himself as well satisfied with the progress
already made by his own army, particularly the cavalry on his northern
flank.</p>

<p>But I had other and more tangible reasons for hope and confidence.
Between the 12th and the 15th, the cavalry and the 3rd Corps had
gained important victories and made splendid advances. During these
days it did not appear that Rawlinson in the north was ever heavily
pressed. The 2nd Corps had made certain progress, though I have always
thought, in regard to them, that more <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> might have been done
had they been directed with more determination and vigour.</p>

<p>The Germans themselves certainly thought so. We intercepted a wireless
message sent by General <span lang="de">von der Marwitz</span>, Commanding the 4th German
Cavalry Corps, who, in wiring to the Commander of the 6th German Army,
commented upon the "weakness" of the 2nd Corps' attack, and the ease
with which he had been able to withstand it.</p>

<p>After the 15th, however, the result of my own observations, and the
reports I continued to receive of the enemy's constantly increasing
strength all along our line, caused me anxiety and induced me to send
the message I have mentioned to Foch.</p>

<p>I was far from satisfied with the situation in the north. Although no
reports had reached us of any great concentration of the enemy there,
I had much reason to fear that troops were being moved east across
Belgium to reinforce him. The French troops on the Yser were not
numerous, and they included many Territorials, whilst the Belgians
were completely tired out. On the right of the Belgians, as far as
<span lang="fr">Menin</span>, there were only the 3rd Cavalry and 7th Infantry Divisions,
both of which stood in need of rest and refit.</p>

<p>Ours was a tremendously long line to guard with so few troops
available. If the enemy broke through the left flank all the British
would be turned, the Belgians and the French troops with them would be
cut off and the sea-coast towns would be gone.</p>

<p>When I looked further south, the prospect was no better. The enemy was
daily and almost hourly getting stronger in front of our line, which
was held by the cavalry and by the 2nd and 3rd Corps. The endurance of
these troops <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> had been heavily taxed, and I had practically
no reserves. Moreover, they were extended on a front much too wide for
their numbers, especially north of the Lys.</p>

<p>Bad as a complete break through by the enemy in the north would have
been, a wedge driven through our lines south of <span lang="fr">Menin</span> would have
entailed still more disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>In a message which I received from <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span> on the 16th, he
expressed great fear that the Germans were intent on attacking between
us and finally separating us. Had they accomplished this, the eventual
alternatives before the British Army would have been to surrender or
be driven into the sea.</p>

<p>I pondered long and deeply on the situation, and finally arrived at
the following conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>If the enemy's threats against Ypres and the Yser were not strongly
met by a corresponding offensive move, then a break through at some
point in that neighbourhood by the Germans was a practical certainty,
and the seaboard would be theirs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although from the south of <span lang="fr">Ypres</span> to <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> the
situation would remain very precarious, I conceived that it might be
possible to hold on till support could arrive.</p>

<p>Since the solution of the problem, as presented to my mind, resolved
itself into a balance of <span class="italic">certain disaster</span> against a disaster which,
although much greater in degree, was still <span class="italic">not</span> a <span class="italic">certainty</span>, I
determined to guard against the former; and on the evening of the 19th
I sent for Sir Douglas Haig and gave him his instructions.</p>

<p>I explained the situation as clearly as possible, and showed him on
the map where and how we thought the enemy's troops were distributed.
I said that at the moment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> I did not think there was much
more than the 3rd German Reserve Corps, with possibly one or two
Divisions attached, between Ostend and <span lang="fr">Menin</span>, but that all reports
pointed to an early arrival of strong reinforcements from the centre
and east of Belgium.</p>

<p>I pointed out to Haig how much importance I attached to the clearing
of Ostend and Bruges before these reinforcements could arrive. I said
I hoped that, with the assistance of the French and Belgian troops on
the north, and Rawlinson on his right flank, he would be able to
effect this object and perhaps, with luck, throw the enemy back on
Ghent. I told him that this was what I particularly wanted to bring
about, but that he would have to be guided by the course of events. I
informed him of Wilson's visit to Foch on the 16th, and Foch's promise
that he would strongly support us on the north.</p>

<p>Orders were then issued to the 1st Corps, of which the following is a
summary:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left10">"The 1st Corps will advance <span class="italic">viâ</span> <span lang="fr">Thourout</span> with the object of
     capturing Bruges. If this is proved to be feasible and
     successful, every endeavour must be made to turn the enemy's left
     flank and drive him back to Ghent. The situation, however, is
     very uncertain, and in the first instance it is only possible to
     direct the 1st Corps with its right on the line <span lang="fr">Ypres&mdash;Roulers</span>.
     Should the forces of the enemy, reported to be moving west
     between Iseghem and <span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>, seriously menace the 4th Corps, it
     is left to the discretion of the Commander of the 1st Corps to
     lend this Corps such assistance as may be necessary."</p>

<p>It had been arranged by the Admiralty that some battleships were to be
held in readiness at Dover, to co-operate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> with our movements
on the north coast should opportunity offer.</p>

<p>My advanced Headquarters were now established at <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span>, and a long
discussion I had there on the 19th with Pulteney and Smith-Dorrien
showed that our front south of <span lang="fr">Menin</span> was being still more severely
pressed.</p>

<p>An attempt by the 4th Corps to advance on <span lang="fr">Menin</span> ended in failure.</p>

<p>The Germans were also fairly active in the north. They pushed back de
Mitry's French Cavalry Corps towards Staden and Zarren, and heavily
attacked the Belgians at Nieuport, but our Allies held their ground
well.</p>

<p>The events of the 20th showed still greater pressure by the enemy. The
3rd Cavalry Division was driven back to the line Zonnebeke&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Julien&mdash;Pilkem by infantry and guns advancing from <span lang="fr">Roulers</span>.</p>

<p>The centre of Allenby's Cavalry Corps fell back on <span lang="fr">Messines</span>, which
place was heavily shelled.</p>

<p>In order to cement the connection between the 2nd and 3rd Corps (now
only maintained by Conneau's French cavalry) I sent the 19th Brigade
to be placed at Pulteney's disposal.</p>

<p>Haig sent two battalions of the 4th Guards Brigade to support the
centre of the 4th Corps between Byng and Capper.</p>

<p>On the 21st, all my worst forebodings as to the enemy's increasing
strength were realised. Intercepted wireless messages established the
certainty that the comparatively small German force which on the night
of the 18th we judged to be between Ostend and <span lang="fr">Menin</span>, was now
reinforced by no less than four Corps, namely, the 21st, 22nd, 26th
and 27th Reserve Corps. These Corps had been hastily formed, and were
not composed of the best troops, They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> were also weak in
numbers and artillery as compared with other Corps.</p>

<p>Although I looked for a great addition to the enemy's numbers within a
few days from the 18th, the strength they actually reached astounded
me. This, taken with the speed in which they appeared in the field,
came like a veritable bolt from the blue.</p>

<p>My only comfort lay in the certainty that my direction of the 1st
Corps to the north was sound and best calculated to meet these new and
startling conditions.</p>

<p>All hope of any immediate offensive had now to be abandoned. It was
simply "up to us" to hold on like grim death to our positions by hard,
resolute fighting, until relief in some shape could come.</p>

<p>It may well be asked how I expected such relief to be afforded, and
whence it could arrive. What hope could be justified in face of such
overpowering odds?</p>

<p>As far as reinforcements went, all I had to look to was the Indian
Corps, one Division of which (the Lahore) detrained on the 19th and
the 20th at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>, and was now concentrating at Wallon-Cappel, west
of Hazebrouck. A wire from Lord Kitchener on the 22nd offered me
another Territorial Battalion to replace the London Scottish on the
lines of communication, if I wished to use the latter at the front. I
had also available the Oxfordshire Yeomanry Cavalry, which had been
landed at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>These were all the British reserves which could possibly be available
for some time. Doubtless, if we could keep our positions for two or
three weeks, much larger reinforcements would be forthcoming. But,
even so, it did not appear that there was any prospect, in the near
future, of attaining definite results by an effective offensive.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> I remained hopeful and confident of the final
result.</p>

<p>On the 23rd I issued the following special Order of the Day to the
troops:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief wishes once more to make
     known to the troops under his command how deeply he appreciates
     the bravery and endurance which they have again displayed since
     their arrival in the northern theatre. In circulating the
     official information which records the splendid victories of our
     Russian Allies, he would remind the troops that the enemy must
     before long withdraw troops to the East and relieve the tension
     on our front. He feels it is quite unnecessary to urge officers,
     non-commissioned officers and men to make a determined effort and
     drive the enemy over the frontier.</p>

<p><span class="left20">(Signed) <span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap">H. Wilson</span>, <abbr title="Major-General">Major-Gen.</abbr>,</span></span><br>
  "7.30 p.m. <span class="add12em">Sub-Chief."</span></p>
</div>

<p>This, then, was my great hope. It was to Russia and to the East that
all eyes were turned at that time. Our Allies had scored a
considerable success in that theatre.</p>

<p>With the failure of the second attack of the Central Powers upon
Warsaw, we may take stock for a moment of Russia's achievement. Russia
made no secret preparation for war, and the outbreak of hostilities
had found her with her Army reorganisation incomplete and a serious
shortage of equipment. She had to bring her men by slender
communications many thousands of miles, but she was ready to strike a
fortnight before Germany believed she could move. Her invasion of East
Prussia had done much to relieve the strain in the West, and heavily
she paid for her quixotry.</p>

<p>But, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> after Tannenburg, she made no mistakes. Von Hindenburg
was enticed to the Niemen and then driven back to disaster at
Augustovo; while in Galicia, Lemberg and all Eastern Galicia were won,
and in two mighty battles three Austrian Armies were heavily beaten.</p>

<p>The Russian Generals showed that rarest of combinations&mdash;an
omnipresent sense of a great strategic objective and a power of
patiently biding their time and of temporarily relinquishing their
objective when prudence demanded. A commander less wise than the Grand
Duke Nicholas would have battled desperately for Cracow, lost a
million men, and at the end of the year have been further from it than
in September. But as it was, the first great advance was promptly
recalled when von Hindenburg threatened Warsaw, and the second was
also abandoned when it was at the very gates of the city.</p>

<p>The first Battle of Warsaw and the Battle of Kazimirjev were
strategically admirable; and the subsequent fighting, from Kozienice
westward, showed the stubborn valour of the Russian soldier. Not less
brilliant was the long retirement from the Warta. There was some
blunder of timing in the fighting between Lodz and Lowicz, for which
<span lang="de">Rennenkampf</span> was held responsible; but there was no flaw in the retreat
to the Bzura or the holding of the river line.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicholas proved that he possessed that highest of
military gifts&mdash;the power of renunciation, of "cutting losses," of
sacrificing the less essential for the more. We must remember that in
all these first five months of war, the united strength of the
Teutonic League outnumbered the Russians by at least half a million.
Locally, as at the first Battle of Warsaw, the latter may have had the
superiority; but in all the retreat from the Warta to the Bzura the
Russian front was markedly inferior <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> in weight of men to von
Mackensen's forces. When we remember this, we can do justice not only
to the excellence of the generalship, but also to the stamina and
courage of the rank and file. Let it be added that reports are
unanimous as to the behaviour of the Russian troops at that time,
their chivalry towards the foe, their good humour, their kindliness
towards each other and their devotion to their commanders.</p>

<p>In a decade the miracle of miracles had happened. Russia had found
herself, and her Armies had become an expression of the national will.
"There is as much difference," wrote one correspondent, "in
organisation, <span class="italic">morale</span>, and efficiency between the armies which some
of us saw in Manchuria ten years ago and which crumpled up before the
Imperial Guards of Japan at the Battle of the Yalu, and the military
machine that these past few weeks has been steadily and surely driving
back the armies of Germany and Austria, as there was between the raw
American recruits who stampeded at the Battle of the Bull Run in 1861
and the veterans who received the surrender of Lee at Appomattox."</p>

<p>If then I am asked upon what I based my hopes during October, 1914,
that is my answer.</p>

<p>The actual fronts and positions of the opposing forces from Nieuport
and the sea to <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span>, on the night of October 21st, were,
according to our latest and best information, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On October 21st the 1st Corps came into line, and after hard fighting
held at night the line Zonnebeke&mdash;Langemarck&mdash;Bixschoote, the left of
the 1st Division being on the Yser Canal.</p>

<p>Some confusion and friction were caused by the withdrawal of de
Mitry's Cavalry Corps to the west bank of the canal, thus uncovering
the flank of the 1st Corps, who were also considerably delayed in
their advance by French Territorial troops blocking the road. In spite
of this, however, the 1st Corps delivered some powerful attacks with
the bayonet, and in the afternoon the artillery of the Corps was in
action for a long time against retreating hostile masses. They were
splendid targets for one brigade in particular, which did tremendous
execution.</p>

<p>The inevitable evils of divided command are clearly shown when Allied
troops are mixed, and the limits of control cannot be properly
defined. As will appear later, I made the most strenuous attempts to
minimise this very serious drawback, either until rectified or
considerably reduced by arrangements between the two Governments, but
all in vain. I could get no hearing.</p>

<p>I was so strongly impressed with the danger of the confusion and
congestion which the divided command was causing in the north, that I
went myself on the evening <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> of the 21st to Ypres, where I was
met by Haig, Rawlinson, de Mitry, and Bidon (who commanded a French
Territorial Division). Arrangements were there made by which the town
was to be at once cleared of the French troops, and the left flank of
the 1st Corps properly covered.</p>

<p>On the 21st I received a visit from General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, who told me he was
at once bringing up the 9th French Army Corps to Ypres.</p>

<p>Two battalions of the Lahore Division were sent at night in motor
omnibuses to Wulverghem, to come under Allenby's orders in support of
the cavalry.</p>

The 3rd Cavalry Division was moved from the left to the right of the
7th Division to be in a position to assist Allenby's Cavalry Corps,
which was being hard pressed on the left at Zonnebeke.

<p>A fine piece of work was done by the 4th Division under Wilson on the
morning of the 21st. The Germans had advanced and captured Le Gheer.
The 4th Division retook it by a brilliant counter-attack and secured
200 prisoners.</p>

<p>I fix the close of the first phase of the Battle of Ypres as the night
of October 26th. By the morning of the 27th the 9th French Corps had
settled down in the trenches which they had taken over from the 1st
Corps in the northern part of the Ypres salient.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, it may be said that, in the last days of this, the
opening period of the battle, the northern portion of our line
progressed slowly but surely, very heavy losses being inflicted on the
enemy and many prisoners were captured.</p>

<p>To the south, however, between Zonnebeke and the <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span>, a certain
amount of ground was lost, but troops <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> held staunchly to
their positions, and there was never any break of a serious nature
made in the line.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the enemy, who had thrown a number of pontoon bridges
across the Lys opposite the Cavalry Corps, appeared to be massing
troops against that part of our line. The Lahore Division having then
reached <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span>, I sent Egerton's Brigade to support the cavalry. I
found there was no chance of getting the Meerut Division for some time
to come, as they were being hopelessly delayed at Marseilles and
Orleans.</p>

<p>At midnight on the 22nd both the 2nd and 3rd Corps Commanders were
very anxious about their positions, and I therefore despatched the
Lahore Division to <span lang="fr">Estaires</span>, from which point it could support either
Corps in case of urgent necessity.</p>

<p>On the 24th I paid a visit to General <span lang="fr">d'Urbal</span> at Poperinghe. He had
come to command the northern French Army. We discussed the situation
together, and he seemed hopeful as to future possibilities.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">D'Urbal</span> impressed me as a man of striking personality. In figure and
bearing he reminded me of the old Murat type of French <span class="italic" lang="fr">beau sabreur</span>.
All his regimental service was passed in the cavalry. I was a great
deal associated with him in the operations at Ypres and afterwards,
when he commanded the French troops on the <span lang="fr">Arras</span> front, and I can
testify to his remarkable powers of command, his fine courage and his
extraordinary tenacity. We were together in many critical situations,
and I have passed some anxious hours in his company; but I never knew
him other than helpful in the highest degree. Nothing ever ruffled the
calmness of his demeanour, or prevented him from exercising that
deliberate and well-weighed judgment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> which was a remarkable
feature of his truly soldierlike character.</p>

<p>Dawnay came back from the 1st Corps on this night, and told me that
late on the previous day the enemy had delivered a succession of
counter-attacks against the front of the 2nd Division just as they
were being relieved. The German infantry came on in dense columns
singing "The Watch on the Rhine." They were simply mown down by our
artillery and rifle fire. The ground was a veritable shambles, and the
1st Corps estimated that in the last three or four days they had put
at least 8,000 Germans <span class="italic">hors-de-combat</span>.</p>

<p>Foch, with whom I had a long interview at <span lang="fr">Cassel</span> on the morning of the
25th, appeared to be quite hopeful and sanguine about the situation on
the canal north of Ypres. He told me that another French regular
Division was to be brought up on either flank at Nieuport and <span lang="fr">Ypres</span>,
and he proposed later to move Conneau from the neighbourhood of
<span lang="fr">Béthune</span>. I told him I could hardly do without Conneau for the moment,
and he agreed to leave him as long as I wanted him.</p>

<p>It is interesting to recall that General Conneau was once a cadet at
the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He proved himself throughout
the war to be a distinguished and able cavalry leader.</p>

<p>The first phase of the Battle of Ypres may be briefly summarised as
the conclusion of the successive attempts, begun a month previously,
to effect a great turning movement round the German right flank. The
operations up to the night of the 26th certainly failed in their
original intention of clearing the coast-line and driving the enemy
from Bruges and Ghent, but they succeeded in establishing a line to
the sea which, if it could be held, brought the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> Germans face
to face with the challenge: "Thus far shalt thou go and no farther."</p>

<p>What this meant to them is proved by the desperate but abortive
attempts they made to break through in the second phase of the battle.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="11">XI</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF YPRES</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="italic">Second Phase, October 27th to October 31st</span></p>

<p>I regard the operations which were carried on by the British Forces in
France during the days of which this chapter treats, as more momentous
and fateful than any others which I directed during my period of
service as Commander-in-Chief in the field. October 31st and November
1st will remain for ever memorable in the history of our country, for,
during those two days, no more than one thin and straggling line of
tired-out British soldiers stood between the Empire and its practical
ruin as an independent first-class Power. I still look back in wonder
on that thin line of defence, stretched, out of sheer necessity, far
beyond its natural and normal power for defence. Right, centre, and
left our men were tried and pressed as troops were never tried and
pressed before.</p>

<p>A lofty tower of some antiquity still stood by itself on the top of a
commanding hill just east of Kemmel. Its days even then were numbered,
and after being heavily shelled, it was completely destroyed later in
the battle. While this tower remained it made an excellent look-out
post. I spent some time there on the 27th, when the crisis of the
battle was approaching.</p>

<p>A glance at the map will show that from this point of view an observer
with strong glasses can compass almost the whole battlefield of Ypres,
where seven British infantry and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> three cavalry divisions
were extended on a front of from 25 to 36 miles.</p>

<p>It was a bright October day with brilliant sunshine, and the line of
fire could be seen all along the high ground encircling the Ypres
salient to the north, the Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge to the east, and
away to the south-east down to the Lys valley almost as far as
<span lang="fr">Armentières</span>, beyond which place the shell-bursts in the sky brought
the right of the British battle line well into the picture.</p>

<p>For four or five days this line was being still further reduced in
strength by the successful efforts of our troops to stem the tide of
the enemy's advance, whilst on their side the Germans were being
gradually reinforced to a strength which, by the 30th, reached about
double our numbers.</p>

<p>In the great onslaught made by the enemy on October 31st and November
1st, sufficient recognition has never yet been given to the glorious
stand made by the Cavalry Corps under Allenby, and when I speak of the
gallantry of the cavalry, I hasten to add that the splendour of their
work was equally shared by Shaw's 9th Brigade of the 3rd Division (1st
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Northumberland Fusiliers, 4th <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Fusiliers, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Lines <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Scots Fusiliers), Egerton's Brigade of
the Indian Corps (1st Connaught Rangers, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own
Beluchis, 57th Wilde's Rifles, 9th Bhopal Infantry), the London
Scottish, and the Oxfordshire Yeomanry.</p>

<p>For close upon 48 hours these troops held the Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span>
ridge against the utmost efforts of no less than two and a half German
Army Corps to dislodge them. Here was the centre of our line of
battle, and, had it given way, disaster would have resulted to the
entire left wing of the Allied line.</p>

<p>In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> almost the same degree I would allot the honours of those
splendid days to the defenders of the Ypres salient, namely, the 9th
(French) Army Corps, the 1st (British) Corps, and the 7th (British)
Division.</p>

<p>It was only a slightly less arduous task which fell upon the 2nd Corps
in this great battle, for they had a long line to hold, in a much more
difficult country, and were subjected to powerful attacks by superior
numbers.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, little distinction to be made between the troops who
fought so bravely all along the line. All were doggedly tenacious; all
were superhumanly brave. The fullest measure of mutual support was
assured by the complete understanding and perfect loyalty which
existed amongst leaders of all ranks, combined with the alertness
shown by all commanders in filling up gaps in the line <span class="italic">without
delay</span>, and in using the troops at their disposal with the utmost
economy.</p>

<p>All said and done, however, the main element of success was to be
found in the devoted bravery and the stern unyielding determination to
"do or die," displayed by the rank and file of the "contemptible
little army" and its reinforcements.</p>

<p>On the 27th I had received an urgent message from Haig about the
exhausted condition of the 7th Division. During the day I went to Haig
at Hooge and had a conference with him and Rawlinson. I decided to
break up the 4th Corps for the present, and to send Rawlinson and his
Headquarters home to supervise the preparation of the 8th Division
pending its despatch to France.</p>

<p>The 7th Division, under Capper, was to be attached to the 1st Corps
until the 8th Division arrived and the 4th Corps could be again
reformed under Rawlinson. Byng with the 3rd Cavalry Division was
placed under Allenby.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> 7th Division took over the ground south of the
<span lang="fr">Ypres&mdash;Menin</span> road, then occupied by some troops of the 1st Division
which were withdrawn in reserve.</p>

<p>The further progress of the enemy between <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> and the sea was
probably now in suspense, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements. We
had reliable reports that the detraining of troops was rapidly
proceeding at <span lang="fr">Lille</span> and <span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>.</p>

<p>During the next two days they began pouring in, and, by October 30th,
from <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> to the north the following German Corps opposed us:&mdash;</p>

<p><span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> to <span lang="fr">Armentières</span> -
<span class="col55">7th, one Brigade of 18th, 19th.</span></p>
<p>North of <span lang="fr">Armentières</span> to east of Ypres -
<span class="col55">13th, 15th, 24th Reserve, 27th Reserve, and two
Ersatz Divisions.</span></p>
<p>East of Ypres to Dixmude -
<span class="col55">26th Reserve, 23rd Reserve, 22nd Reserve.</span></p>
<p>Dixmude to Nieuport -
<span class="col55">3rd Reserve and 4th Ersatz Division</span></p>

<p>Roughly speaking there were some twelve German Corps opposed to seven
of the Allies, whilst the enemy enjoyed enormous artillery
superiority, both numerically and in calibre of guns.</p>

<p>The condition of the 2nd Corps was again causing me anxiety, and the
Corps Commander was calling out for help and reinforcements. It had
also given cause for apprehension to our Allies.</p>

<p>Willcocks arrived on the 27th, and took over command of the Indian
Corps in the field.</p>

<p>On this day Prince Maurice of Battenberg died of his wounds. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span>
He was a young officer of great promise, and much beloved in his
regiment, the 60th Rifles.</p>

<p>The 28th saw the loss of <span lang="fr">Neuve Chapelle</span> by the 2nd Corps.</p>

<p>I met Smith-Dorrien and Willcocks together at <span lang="fr">Merville</span>, and arranged
for the Indian Corps to take over the line now held by the 2nd Corps.
The 2nd Corps was to fall back to <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span> in reserve.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th I had got a message from General <span lang="fr">de
Maud'huy</span>, commanding the 10th French Army on our right. It was sent
through the French Mission, and was to the effect that he was very
anxious about his left flank. He added some criticism of his own for
my consideration.</p>

<p>The 6th Division under Keir scored a success on the 28th. On their
front, just south of <span lang="fr">Armentières</span>, they repulsed a severe
counter-attack in which the enemy left several hundred dead in front
of their trenches.</p>

<p>The supply of ammunition now began to cause me increasing anxiety, and
my apprehension under this head continued more or less throughout the
whole period of my Command in France.</p>

<p>October 29th witnessed the opening of that most critical stage in the
first period of the war, to which I have already referred.</p>

<p>At nine in the morning of that day the centre of the Ypres salient,
held by the 1st and 7th Divisions, was attacked in the neighbourhood
of Gheluvelt by large masses of the enemy, who forced back our troops
on the latter place. Well organised counter-attacks, which were
splendidly led, repulsed the enemy during the day with heavy
casualties. By nightfall the 1st and 7th Divisions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> had
recovered all the ground they had lost, and the position that night
(October 29) was somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Seventh and part of the First Division held a line which extended
on the left from a point about five hundred yards north of the
cross-roads on the <span lang="fr">Ypres-Menin</span> road, and ran thence south through the
cross-roads to the village of Kruiseij on the right, where the Seventh
Division joined up with the cavalry. This line was well to the east of
Gheluvelt, and consequently represented a considerable gain as
compared with the ground held the day before.</p>

<p>The left or northern portion of Haig's line extended slightly to the
west of Reutel and Poezelhoek (both these places being held by the
enemy), and was continued by the Second Division to the east of
Zonnebeke Station, where they joined the right of the Ninth French
Corps. The attacking troops consisted of the Twenty-seventh German
Reserve Corps and the Sixth Bavarian Division, which suffered a very
severe check; their losses were known to be heavy. In the middle of
the day I sent Haig the London Scottish, which was the only reserve I
had left. They were moved in motor omnibuses to Ypres.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 29th I went to <span lang="fr">Cassel</span> and had a long
conference with Foch. The canal and the river Yser, from Ypres to the
sea, were capable of wide inundation which would afford excellent
cover and protection all along that battle front. From the first I had
been most anxious that this inundation should be carried out; but
there was great opposition to it. Whether this came from the French
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> or the Belgians I did not know, but I am much inclined to
think that the French generals, in their sanguine anticipation of an
immediate advance east, feared that such an obstacle would hamper
them. When I saw Foch on this afternoon, however, he was all in favour
of the inundation. He told me he thought the enemy was very "slack" in
the north, that fresh French troops were being landed at Dunkirk, and
that he still expected to see his hopes of an early advance realized.
It was impossible to be closely associated with Foch and not come
under the spell of his sanguine temperament, which was always a great
help to me, although on this occasion I knew perfectly well that the
enemy was increasing in numbers on our front, and that it was utterly
impossible for us at that time to do more than hold our own with the
utmost difficulty.</p>

<p>At dawn on October 30 the Nineteenth Brigade (Second Battalion Royal
Welsh Fusiliers, First Battalion Scottish Rifles, First Battalion
Middlesex Regiment, and Second Battalion Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders) carried out a brilliant counter-attack with the bayonet,
heavily repulsing the enemy on the right of the Third Corps.</p>

<p>An hour later Haig reported that he was being heavily shelled all
along his front, and that the enemy was moving in great force to
attack Byng's Third Cavalry Division on his right. Gough had sent two
regiments and a battery of horse artillery to support Byng. One of
these regiments (the Royal Dragoons) had, with great dash and
gallantry, repulsed an attack on the château at Hollebeke.</p>

<p>I went early in the morning to Allenby's Headquarters at Kemmel, where
Barrow (his Chief of Staff) reported the situation to me. I ascended
the tower I have spoken of already, to get a view of the
field, which by this time had been drawn nearer, but mist prevented
good observation.</p>

<p>Hearing heavy firing towards Ypres, I went to Haig's Headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> at Hooge. Whilst I was with Haig, Allenby came in.</p>

<p>It appeared that strong forces were attacking the 3rd and 2nd Cavalry
Divisions under Byng and Gough respectively, in and around Hollebeke.
Allenby had sent a brigade from the 1st Cavalry Division on his right
to support Gough, who had also been obliged to recall the support
which he had previously sent to Byng. Haig had sent the London
Scottish to support Gough, and had brought down Bulfin with most of
the 2nd Brigade to strengthen the 7th Division on his right.
Furthermore, he had ordered Lord Cavan with the 4th (Guards) Brigade
(2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadier Guards, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Coldstream Guards, 3rd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Coldstream Guards, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Irish Guards) to move south of the <span lang="fr">Menin</span>
road, ready to counter-attack towards Hollebeke.</p>

<p>By the evening the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions had fallen back to
the canal, and the enemy was in possession of Hollebeke.</p>

<p>On Allenby's right the 1st Cavalry Division was heavily pressed at
<span lang="fr">Messines</span>; the enemy gained a footing in the village, but were driven
out later in the evening.</p>

<p>On Haig's left the 6th Infantry Brigade (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> The King's
(Liverpool) <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Staffs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Berks <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>
and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Kings Royal Rifle">K.R.R.</abbr>) was attacked three times during the day, and on
one occasion the enemy infantry reached the barbed wire, close to the
trenches.</p>

<p>North of the 1st Corps and on the Yser, heavy fighting went on
throughout the 30th, but the situation there remained practically
unchanged.</p>

<p>Late on this night, orders were sent to Smith-Dorrien to move Shaw's
(9th) Brigade of the 3rd Division to <span lang="fr">Neuve-Église</span> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> (about 5
miles east-north-east of <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span>), to come under Allenby's orders.</p>

<p>About 6 p.m. the line of the 11th Brigade (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Somerset <abbr title="Light-Infantry">L.I.</abbr>,
1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="east">E.</abbr> Lancs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Hampshire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr> and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Rifle Brigade) in the 4th Division under Hunter Weston was broken at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Yves, but the ground lost was brilliantly recaptured by the
brigade later in the evening.</p>

<p>Such was the general situation at 2 a.m. on October 31st, at which
hour I received a visit from Foch, who promised to let me have
effective support for Haig on this day, namely, five battalions of
French infantry and three batteries of artillery.</p>

<p>Shortly after dawn on this fateful 31st October, we had news that a
serious infantry attack was developing on the left of the 4th Division
in the valley of the River <span lang="fr">Douve</span>. The 4th Division was able to extend
its line some little way to the north of the river and thus release
troops of the 1st Cavalry Division, which subsequently fought fiercely
all day at <span lang="fr">Messines</span>. Throughout the day the left of the 4th Division
rendered valuable and efficient support, as did the artillery on Hill
63, about one mile north of Ploegsteert.</p>

<p>But the great events of the day took place between Gheluvelt on the
north and <span lang="fr">Messines</span> on the south.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Allenby reported that <span lang="fr">Messines</span> was being heavily
attacked, and that the 9th Lancers had been withdrawn after suffering
severely; that the eastern exit of the town was held by the 4th and
5th Dragoon Guards, and that the situation was "decidedly critical."</p>

<p>A heavy attack had been delivered against the right of the 1st Cavalry
Division shortly after 7 a.m., and an Indian <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> Battalion of
Rifles (the 57th, attached to the 1st Cavalry Division) were driven
from their trenches. The reserves, however, held on, and the
Inniskilling Fusiliers retook the trenches which the 57th had lost.</p>

<p>At 9.30 a.m. large masses of infantry were reported to be advancing
against the 2nd Cavalry Division between Oesttaverne and Roozebeek,
and long columns of the enemy were seen on the road leading from the
former place to <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eloi</span>.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I reached Allenby's Headquarters, which were now at
Groote Vierstraat (between Mont Kemmel and Ypres). After we had
discussed matters, Gough arrived. Explaining the situation to me, he
said he was in occupation of the canal to the north-east of Hollebeke,
whence he had been driven back the day before. Thence his line
extended south till it joined the left of the 1st Cavalry Division. He
was in complete possession of Wytschaete, but he asked Allenby for
some further support on the canal. Kavanagh's Brigade (1st Life
Guards, 2nd Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards), which had been
returned by Haig, was sent to him.</p>

<p>Just then I got a report that the five battalions of French infantry,
which had been promised by Foch, were now directed to make a
counter-attack from Verbranden Molen towards the canal at the
dangerous point.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions were heavily attacked during the
day, but by dark they held the same ground as on the night before.</p>

<p>The most critical fighting of the day in this part of the line was at
<span lang="fr">Messines</span>, on Allenby's right.</p>

<p>By 9 a.m. the cavalry were driven out of <span lang="fr">Messines</span>, holding only one or
two houses on the eastern side. Owing to heavy pressure elsewhere, no
support was available until Shaw's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> (9th) Infantry Brigade
could arrive. It reached Kemmel at 10 a.m.</p>

<p>Gough sent the London Scottish to join the 3rd Hussars in support of
Bingham's 4th Cavalry Brigade (Household Cavalry, composite regiment,
6th Dragoon Guards and 3rd Hussars) on the left of the 3rd Division.</p>

<p>At the same time, three battalions of French infantry, supported by 12
guns, were just starting their attack from <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eloi</span> on Oesttaverne.</p>

<p>At about 11.45 a.m., two battalions King's Own Scottish Borderers and
King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry were sent forward to retake the
<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge.</p>

<p>General de Lisle, commanding the 1st Cavalry Division, was commanding
at <span lang="fr">Messines</span>. The Oxfordshire Yeomanry and an Indian battalion were the
last reserves sent up to him.</p>

<p>About noon, when the 1st Cavalry Brigade were still clinging to the
western edge of <span lang="fr">Messines</span>, a counter-attack by the 3rd Hussars and
London Scottish began on the north of the village. By 1 p.m.,
considerable progress had been made. The 3rd Corps had regained the
trenches north of the River <span lang="fr">Douve</span> to within half a mile of <span lang="fr">Messines</span>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="King's Own Scottish Borderers">K.O.S.B.</abbr> were on the right of the town, and the <abbr title="Kings Own Yorkshire Light Infantry">K.O.Y.L.I.</abbr> on the
left. The London Scottish and 3rd Hussars were engaged on the north of
the latter, and an intense struggle for the convent and southern
portion of the town, which was a point from which the lost ground
could be recovered, was proceeding to our advantage.</p>

<p>At this hour the news appeared more hopeful, and I left Allenby in
order to join Haig at Hooge, east of Ypres. A battalion of French
arrived to support the troops fighting at <span lang="fr">Messines</span> just as I was
leaving.</p>

<p>I learned later that the London Scottish attack reached the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span>
north edge of <span lang="fr">Messines</span> shortly after 2 p.m.; that towards 4 p.m. the
attack was checked on the <span lang="fr">Messines</span>&mdash;Wytschaete road by heavy
artillery; that fierce fighting went on in the streets, and that the
town was severely shelled; but that, later, the Germans were driven
completely out, and were holding the ridge to the east, including a
ruined factory and some farms to the south.</p>

<p>At nightfall the line held about <span lang="fr">Messines</span> was the same as in the
morning.</p>

<p>As I passed through Ypres on my way to Haig, there were manifest signs
of unusual excitement, and some shells were already falling in the
place. It is wonderful with what rapidity the contagion of panic
spreads through a civilian population. I saw loaded vehicles leaving
the town, and people were gathered in groups about the streets
chattering like monkeys or rushing hither and thither with frightened
faces.</p>

<p>As we passed by the ancient Cloth Hall, the old Cathedral, and the
other splendid examples of Flemish architecture for which this town
was famed, I did not realise how soon the atmosphere of German
"frightfulness" was to reduce all these noble buildings to a heap of
ruins. Although to-day Ypres as a city has ceased to exist, I am
thankful to know that no German soldier has ever set foot within its
walls save as a prisoner. Here, as at <span lang="fr">Verdun</span>, they did not pass; and
the glory is that of every soldier in the ranks.</p>

<p>On reaching the eastern exit of the town, on my way to Hooge, I was
stopped by a guard specially posted by First Corps Headquarters, with
orders to prevent anyone leaving the city.</p>

<p>Satisfying them as to my identity, I proceeded on my way. I had not
gone more than a mile when the traffic on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> the road began to
assume a most anxious and threatening appearance. It looked as if the
whole of the 1st Corps was about to fall back in confusion on Ypres.
Heavy howitzers were moving west at a trot&mdash;always a most significant
feature of a retreat&mdash;and ammunition and other wagons blocked the road
almost as far as the eye could see. In the midst of the press of
traffic, and along both sides of the road, crowds of wounded came
limping along as fast as they could go, all heading for Ypres. Shells
were screaming overhead and bursting with reverberating explosions in
the adjacent fields.</p>

<p>This spectacle filled me with misgiving and alarm. It was impossible
for my motor-car to proceed at any pace, so we alighted and covered
the rest of the way to Haig's Headquarters on foot, nor did I receive
any encouragement on the way to hope for better things.</p>

<p>The château of Hooge, where 1st Army Headquarters were situated, has
long since been erased from the face of the earth in the severe
fighting which had raged about it. But as I found it on that October
afternoon, it was a typical modern red brick château, approached by a
gate and a short avenue from the road. Shells were falling about the
place, and the château was already beginning to show the effects of
artillery fire.</p>

<p>I found Haig and John Gough, his Chief of Staff, in one of the rooms
on the ground floor, poring over maps and evidently much disconcerted.
But, though much perturbed in mind and very tired in body and brain,
Haig was cool and alert as ever.</p>

<p>Both he and Gough gave me a bad account of the state of affairs.</p>

<p>This is what happened on the front of the 1st Corps. In the morning
the position along the line was normal. About <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> 10 o'clock
rather a disturbing situation developed south and south-east of
Gheluvelt. A local counter-attack failed, and some trenches east of
the village had to be abandoned. There was heavy shelling along the
front of the 7th Division and of the 2nd Brigade (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Sussex
<abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> Lancs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Northampton <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 2nd
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Kings Royal Rifle">K.R.R.</abbr>), but no infantry attack.</p>

<p>At 10.30 a.m. the 1st Division line, north of the <span lang="fr">Ypres&mdash;Menin</span> road,
was forced to retire in face of a heavy infantry attack covered by
artillery. Lomax, commanding the Division, ordered the 1st (Guards)
Brigade (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Coldstream Guards, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards, 1st
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Black Watch and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Cameron Highlanders) north of the road
to be ready to enfilade the enemy's advance.</p>

<p>By 11.30 a.m., thanks to strong support from our artillery, the
situation about Gheluvelt became easier; but at 12.15 p.m. the enemy
were again reported to be massing east of the village, and the
situation once more became threatening.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="general officer commanding-in-charge">G.O.C.</abbr> 1st Division made arrangements for calling on the 2nd
Worcesters (5th Brigade, 2nd Division) for a counter-attack due south,
if necessary. Shortly before this, owing to a report from the 2nd
Cavalry Division that successive lines of German infantry were massing
for attack against Oesttaverne, and in response to an urgent call by
the Cavalry Corps, the 6th Cavalry Brigade (3rd Dragoon Guards, 1st
Dragoons and 10th Hussars), one battery <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr> and one battery
Howitzers, were sent at 11 a.m. to their support. The 7th Cavalry
Brigade (1st and 2nd Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards) was moved at
10.30 a.m. to a point midway between Hooge and Zillebeke.</p>

<p>At 12.30 p.m. the Germans developed their attack against <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span>
Gheluvelt in great force, and the line of the 1st Division was broken.
A General Staff Officer from the 1st Corps, who was sent forward to
discover the exact position of the 3rd Cavalry Division, reached 1st
Division Headquarters in time to find the situation critical, the line
being broken and a part at least of the Division falling back rapidly
along the main road. General Lomax ordered his reserves to hold the
east edge of the woods just south-east of the bend of the road, while
the 7th Cavalry Brigade was ordered to take up a line astride the road
on the east side of the château grounds, behind which the 1st Division
could rally.</p>

<p>At this time all was quiet on the front of the 2nd Division, while on
the south the 7th Division, assisted by troops which General Bulfin
had collected under his orders, were being heavily shelled. The
retirement of the 1st Division exposed the left of the 7th Division
and, owing to this, the Royal Scots Fusiliers (21st Brigade), who
stuck to their trenches, were cut off and surrounded. A strong
infantry attack was delivered against the right of the 7th Division at
1.30 p.m., a short time after the <abbr title="general officer commanding-in-charge">G.O.C.</abbr> 7th Division had moved two
battalions of his reserve in rear of his right.</p>

<p>On receiving a report of the situation on the front of the 1st
Division, Haig issued the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The line Frezenberg&mdash;Westhoek&mdash;bend of Main Road&mdash;Klein
Zillebeke&mdash;bend of canal to be held at all costs."</p>

<p>From Haig and Gough I learned that Lomax had been badly wounded,
Monro, commanding the 2nd Division, temporarily disabled, and several
Divisional Staff Officers killed at 1.15 p.m. that afternoon, when the
Headquarters of the 1st and 2nd Divisions were shelled. On this
General Bulfin was ordered to take command of the 1st <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span>
Division, handing over the command of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades to
General Lord Cavan, commanding the 4th (Guards) Brigade. Amongst the
dead was poor Freddie Kerr, of the Highland Light Infantry, whom I had
known very well at Aldershot. He was a rising man, and one of the most
promising young Staff Officers in the Army. But the worst news was
that the 1st Division had broken back and were in full retreat, only a
mile or so to the east of where we were standing, with the Germans at
their heels.</p>

<p>What grieved me almost more than anything else was that the 1st Corps
should at last be forced back after the glorious stand they had made.
I felt that they had done far more than could be expected of any men,
and that even if they were driven to the sea they had earned their
country's lasting gratitude for the determined fight they had made. No
shadow of blame could be laid upon them or their commander.</p>

<p>I sought to express what I felt to Douglas Haig in order to try and
soften the cruel blow I knew this catastrophe would be to him and to
his command. To me, indeed, it seemed as though our line at last was
broken. If this were the case, the immense numerical superiority of
the enemy would render retreat a very difficult operation,
particularly in view of the fact that Ypres and the River Yser lay in
our immediate rear. Our only hope now seemed to be to make a stand on
the line <span lang="fr">Ypres&mdash;Messines</span>; but it was a great question whether this
would be possible in face of a close and determined pursuit.
Personally I felt as if the last barrier between the Germans and the
Channel seaboard was broken down, and I viewed the situation with the
utmost gravity.</p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> was a dramatic half hour, the worst I ever spent in a life
full of vicissitudes such as mine had been.</p>

<p>It had a truly dramatic climax.</p>

<p>At about 3 p.m. a Staff Officer galloped up to the front of the
château with the news that the 1st Division had rallied and again
moved forward. Gheluvelt was once more in our hands!</p>

<p>The 1st Division had rallied on the line of the woods east of the bend
of the <span lang="fr">Menin</span> road; the German advance by the road had been checked by
enfilade fire from the north.</p>

<p>What had happened was that the attack against the right of the 7th
Division had forced its 22nd Brigade to retire, thus exposing the left
of the 2nd Brigade (1st Division). The <abbr title="general officer commanding-in-charge">G.O.C.</abbr> 7th Division used his
reserve, already posted in this flank, to restore the line, but, in
the meantime, the 2nd Brigade, finding their flank laid bare, had been
forced to withdraw. The right of the 7th Division thus advanced as the
left of the 2nd Brigade went back, with the result that the right of
the 7th Division was exposed, but managed to hang on in its old
trenches till nightfall.</p>

<p>At 2.40 p.m. the situation appeared so serious that orders were issued
that although every effort should be made to hold on to the line
originally given, if that should be impossible, the line Verbranden
Molen&mdash;Zillebeke&mdash;Halte&mdash;Potijze was to be held to the last.</p>

<p>But, as the events turned out, the pendulum was swinging towards us
once more. On the <span lang="fr">Menin</span> road a counter-attack delivered by the left of
the 1st (Guards) Brigade and the right of the 2nd Division against the
left flank of the German line was completely successful. By 3.30 p.m.
Gheluvelt had been retaken with the bayonet by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> the 2nd
Worcesters, admirably supported by the 42nd Brigade <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr> The left of
the 7th Division, profiting by the recapture of Gheluvelt, advanced
almost to its original line, and connection between the 1st and 7th
Divisions was re-established.</p>

<p>I could not then discover who was actually responsible for this
dramatic success or to whom the chief credit was due. The rally had
been centred on the 2nd Worcesters (5th Brigade, 2nd Division), who
behaved with the utmost gallantry.</p>

<p>It was not until some time after the battle that I ascertained that
the original moving spirit had been Brigadier-General FitzClarence,
<abbr title="Victoria Cross">V.C.</abbr>, Commanding the 1st Guards Brigade (1st Division).</p>

<p>Captain Thorne, who was Staff Captain of the 1st Guards Brigade on
October 31st, made the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On October 31st, 1914, the 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Worcester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr> were in reserve
to the 2nd Division who were on our left. About 8 a.m., finding the
1st Brigade rather pressed and having no reserve of our own, General
FitzClarence got the loan of one company of the Worcesters, and this
was placed along the railway line to Bercelaere, just north of
Gheluvelt, to cover our right flank and to catch any Germans emerging
from the village. This they did most successfully. Then a little
later, when General FitzClarence found out how badly things were going
on the right of the Scots Guards, he at once decided that an immediate
counter-attack was to be made, and sent me off with orders to get hold
of the remaining three companies of the Worcesters, and instruct the
<abbr title="Commanding officer">C.O.</abbr> to counter-attack on the Scots Guards' right; the latter were
holding the château. The three companies then went up through the
company lining the railway, through the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> château garden,
drove the Germans out of the village north of the main road, and
re-established the line. It was undoubtedly entirely on General
FitzClarence's initiative that this counter-attack was made, as he
gave me the order personally."</p>

<p>Major Hankey, who was commanding the 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> of the Worcester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>
on that day, fully corroborated Captain Thorne's account. He wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel perfectly certain that by shoving us in at the time and place
he did, the General saved the day. If he had waited any longer, I
don't think I could have got the battalion up in time to save the
South Wales Borderers, and fill up the gap." This most distinguished
Irish Guardsman, FitzClarence, was killed a week or two later in the
same part of the field, and his loss was most deeply felt.</p>

<p>I determined that every possible effort must be made to prevent the
recurrence of such a situation as I had just witnessed, and at once
hurried off to find Foch. He was with <span lang="fr">d'Urbal</span>, and we all went
thoroughly into the situation.</p>

<p>Foch told me that on the morning of the next day (November 1st) a
French mixed force, up to the strength of a Division, would
concentrate on the line <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eloi</span>&mdash;Wytschaete at daybreak, and advance
from that line to attack the left flank of the forces in front of
Haig. Similarly the 9th French Corps on Haig's left would be ordered
to attack south-east against the enemy's right.</p>

<p>I sent Barry (one of my <abbr title="aide de camp">A.D.C.s</abbr>) and Brinsley FitzGerald (my Private
Secretary), who were both with me throughout the day, back to Haig
with a full account of my interview with Foch. They returned later
with the information that the line of the 1st Corps had been
completely <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> re-established, and that just before dark
Kavanagh's 7th Cavalry Brigade (1st and 2nd Life Guards and Royal
Horse Guards) had done some good work in driving back the enemy. At
the end of the day the brigade again became available to close a
dangerous gap which had occurred on the right of the 7th Division. In
the woods the Household Cavalry encountered large numbers of Germans,
whom they cleared out, capturing many prisoners and inflicting heavy
losses. Haig reported that they were of great assistance in restoring
the line.</p>

<p>Throughout this great day (October 31st) the flank of the 1st Corps
had held fast to their ground. But the wooded country which intervened
enabled superior forces of the enemy to penetrate to a dangerous
extent between them.</p>

<p>In fighting such as this it was inevitable that troops should become
much intermingled and mixed up. It was not only so as between larger
or smaller units of the same Army, but also by reason of the fervent
loyalty and fine feeling which has happily always been so strongly
marked a feature amongst the Allies.</p>

<p>Throughout the day no effort was spared by any of the units engaged to
afford each other the utmost mutual support without any regard to
nationality, nor was there a moment's hesitation and time lost in
waiting to get orders from superior authority.</p>

<p>Not many hours of darkness had elapsed, however, before new anxieties
arose in connection with the line held by the cavalry on the
Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge.</p>

<p>Events hardly less momentous than those of October 31st were before
us.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="12">XII</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF YPRES</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="italic">Third Phase, November 1st to November 10th</span></p>

<p>The importance attached by the Germans to the fighting of October 31st
and November 1st was emphasised by the presence of the Emperor at
<span lang="fr">Courtrai</span>. An intercepted wireless message informed us that he was to
go to Hollebeke, no doubt with the intention of heading a "triumphal
entry" into <span lang="fr">Ypres</span>.</p>

<p>Our airmen endeavoured to give him as warm a reception as possible,
and we had information that his quarters were changed at least once in
consequence of their activity.</p>

<p>I issued an Order of the Day to the troops, announcing the presence of
the august visitor on our front, and urging them to give His Majesty a
good demonstration of what the "contemptible little army" could do.
Right splendidly did they respond.</p>

<p>Throughout the night of the 31-1st, the 2nd Cavalry Division was
heavily attacked all along the Wytschaete-<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge. The enemy
gained a footing in the village of Wytschaete, broke through the line
north of <span lang="fr">Messines</span> and turned the left flank of the trenches held by
the London Scottish. With devoted gallantry the reserve company of
this battalion made repeated charges with the bayonet, which checked
the enemy's advance and enabled the battalion to hold the position.
This it did <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> until daylight. The Germans were then discovered
to be well round both flanks, and a retirement became inevitable. This
was carried out very steadily under heavy rifle and machine-gun fire
in the direction of Wulverghem.</p>

<p>At 3 a.m. the 12th Lancers, the Northumberland Fusiliers, and the
Lincolns made a counter-attack and re-established the original line.
The cavalry fought on foot with the bayonet in the narrow streets of
the village, and were reported to me as equal to the best infantry in
such work.</p>

<p>By 6.30 a.m. the enemy had been reinforced, and were able to drive
back the 2nd Cavalry Division with the troops attached and reoccupy
Wytschaete. This loss, coupled with the enemy's seizure of the ridge
north of <span lang="fr">Messines</span>, rendered the latter place untenable by the 1st
Cavalry Division. They retired slowly to an entrenched line north of
Wulverghem.</p>

<p>Somewhat the same kind of situation arose here now as on the day
before at Gheluvelt. Since the night of October 30th the Cavalry Corps
and attached troops had been holding on to the Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span>
ridge against overwhelming numbers of the enemy. They were utterly
exhausted, and the French marching to their succour were still some
way off.</p>

<p>At 5 a.m. two battalions of the 2nd Corps were despatched from
<span lang="fr">Bailleul</span> to <span lang="fr">Neuve-Église</span>, and further reinforcements were ordered to
follow them an hour later. These troops had only themselves just got
back into reserve, after a most trying and exhausting experience on
the right of our line lasting for nearly three weeks. They also stood
in dire need of rest, but they were the only reserves of any kind at
my disposal.</p>

<p>At <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> 10 a.m. on the 1st, the exhausted 2nd Cavalry Division was
retiring on Mont Kemmel, which they were in no condition to hold if
the enemy pressed on vigorously after them. But once again, as on the
31st, the situation was saved by a desperate effort. Some battalions
of French infantry attacked on the left of the 2nd Cavalry Division
and checked the enemy's advance, which was finally held off until,
some time later, the head of the 16th French Army Corps arrived and
regained the western end of Wytschaete.</p>

<p>The 3rd Corps had reported early in the morning that the position of
its left flank was rendered precarious by the loss of <span lang="fr">Messines</span>. With
the support furnished by the 2nd Corps, as narrated above, Pulteney
was able to draw back his left towards <span lang="fr">Neuve-Église</span> and form a flank
facing north, covering the important artillery position on Hill 63.
This move had threatened in flank the German advance on the
Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge, and assisted greatly in securing the
retirement of the cavalry in good order.</p>

<p>At 12.15 p.m. the situation was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division occupied an entrenched position running to
the east and north-east of Wulverghem, in touch on the right with the
reconstructed line of the 3rd Corps and on the left with the 2nd
Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>After the successful advance of the French, the 2nd Cavalry Division
was drawn in to the south of Wytschaete, and its left was in touch
with the 16th French Corps holding the western border of that village.</p>

<p>The 1st Corps was also heavily attacked on November 1st. On the front
held by the 1st Division, part of the 1st Brigade was driven from its
trenches; but the position was retaken by counter-attack, and in the
evening the line <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> held was the same as on October 31st. The
1st Division was much exhausted and weakened by heavy losses. The 7th
Division remained only 2,000 strong. The 3rd Cavalry Division was
given temporarily to the 1st Corps, and assisted to hold the position.
The 9th French Corps on the left of our 1st Corps was unable to make
any progress during the day.</p>

<p>Information came in towards evening that the enemy was again massing
against Gheluvelt. I went to Vlamertinghe to consult with <span lang="fr">Foch</span> and
<span lang="fr">d'Urbal</span>, who told me that nine French battalions and some batteries
would reach Ypres early on the morning of the 2nd. Foch promised me
that he would at once dispatch two battalions of Zouaves to support
Haig's centre.</p>

<p>Reviewing the situation as it presented itself on October 31st and
November 1st, 1914, I believe that the vital interests of the British
Empire were in great danger on both these days. That is to say, the
whole coast-line from <span lang="fr">Havre</span> to Ostend was within an ace of falling
into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>In recalling the fateful hours of those two wonderful days and nights,
I think we were perhaps in the greatest danger between 2 a.m. and 11
a.m. on Sunday, November 1st. Had the French 16th Corps arrived only
an hour later than it did, the German advance from the line
Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> would have gained such volume, strength, and
impetus, that nothing could have saved Mont Kemmel from falling into
their hands. A vital wedge would have been driven into the very centre
of our line.</p>

<p>The enormous numerical and artillery superiority of the Germans must
be remembered. If they had turned the situation to full account, we
should have seen all the French, British, and Belgian troops lying to
the north of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> an east and west line through Mont Kemmel, cut
off and hemmed against the coast.</p>

<p>The greatest threat of disaster with which we were faced in 1914 was
staved off by the devoted bravery and endurance displayed by the
Cavalry Corps under a commander, General Allenby, who handled them
throughout with consummate skill. The same high praise must be given
to those two redoubtable divisional leaders, Hubert Gough and de
Lisle.</p>

<p>The cavalry was admirably supported and helped by Shaw and Egerton
with the splendid battalions of infantry which composed the brigades
they commanded, and none of us will ever forget how those French
battalions on the left of the 2nd Cavalry Division checked the enemy
by their gallant and determined advance at the most critical moment.</p>

<p>It is no disparagement, however, to the other troops engaged if I lay
stress on the fact that it was the cavalry alone who, for more than a
fortnight previously, had been disputing foot by foot every yard of
the ground to the River Lys. They had fought day and night with the
utmost tenacity, and the battles of October 31st and November 1st were
but the climax to a long and bitter spell of heroic effort.</p>

<p>For the information of non-military readers, it is necessary for me to
explain that a cavalry division fighting on foot is at a great
disadvantage as compared with an infantry division. When horses cannot
be used in the fighting, they have still to be looked after, and this
takes many men away from the fighting line. A cavalry division
consists ordinarily of three brigades, but when employed in the
trenches they get little more than half that number into the firing
line. They have nothing like the same "gun power" <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> as an
infantry division. But the mobility of the cavalry arm will always be
found to compensate in large degree for these manifest disadvantages.
Taking into account the losses they had suffered, they can hardly have
opposed 2,000 rifles to the onslaught of what has been computed at
more than two German Army Corps.</p>

<p>Of late years our custom has been to train our cavalry to fight on
foot, and in the present war we have reaped the fruit of this wise
policy. But the instinct which must be inculcated in the horse soldier
to regard his horse as his chief reliance, must always disqualify him
to some extent for the <span class="italic">rôle</span> which our cavalry were called upon to
fulfil throughout the momentous issues in the history of the war of
which this chapter treats. I may mention in passing that it was this
same cavalry spirit, or instinct, with which the British cavalry is so
strongly imbued, which enabled them to show to such splendid advantage
in the mounted combats of the earlier phases of the war.</p>

<p>I must add a few words as to the fine part played in the fighting of
November 1st by the Oxfordshire Hussars and the London Scottish. They
were the first Territorial troops who fought in the war.</p>

<p>After disembarking at Dunkirk the Oxfordshire Hussars took part in the
important operations connected with the Belgian retreat from Antwerp,
and rendered most valuable aid in the defence of the
Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge when that piece of ground was held with
such marvellous tenacity by the Cavalry Division against overwhelming
odds.</p>

<p>As for the London Scottish, their services on these two days are well
summarised in a memorandum sent in to me by Allenby.</p>

<p>"The London Scottish," he wrote, "came under my orders on the evening
of October 30th, 1914, and were detailed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> to the support of
the 2nd Cavalry Division on the following morning. They went into
action at 10 a.m., October 31st, with a strength of 26 officers and
786 men, and occupied trenches in conjunction with the 4th Cavalry
Brigade. They held these trenches throughout the day, being subjected
from time to time to heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. From 9 p.m.
onwards during the night October 31st&mdash;November 1st, the Germans
attacked the trenches of the London Scottish continuously, and at 2
a.m. they succeeded in turning the left in large numbers. The
situation was restored at the point of the bayonet by the Reserve
Company. By daylight on November 1st the Germans had, however, turned
both flanks, and it became necessary to retire. The retirement was
directed on Wulverghem, and was carried out steadily under heavy rifle
and machine-gun fire. At 8 a.m. the same morning, the London Scottish
went forward again to take their places in the trenches alongside the
1st Cavalry Division, and there they remained until relieved at dusk
that evening.</p>

<p>"Throughout these operations, which lasted for two days, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, October
31st and November 1st, the losses of the London Scottish amounted to
278, or about 34 per cent, of their strength. Rarely, if ever, have
second line troops sustained unshaken so high a percentage of
casualties.</p>

<p><span class="left50">"<span class="smcap">E. H. H. Allenby</span>, <abbr title="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-Gen.</abbr>,</span><br>
<span class="left60">"Commanding Cavalry Corps."</span></p>

<p>I sent the following message to the Officer Commanding the London
Scottish:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you and your splendid regiment to accept my warmest
congratulations and thanks for the fine work you did on Saturday. You
have given a glorious lead and example to all Territorial Corps
fighting in France."</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> saw the battalion personally a few days later, and said a
few words to the men on parade. How they had suffered was only too
pathetically apparent. Whilst there was work to be done and an enemy
to be held at bay no other thought filled any of their minds than to
die fighting, if necessary, to the last man. But when these
Territorials returned for a term of well-earned rest to their
cantonments, with the excitement and danger behind them, a severe
reaction came upon them. The heavy losses amongst their friends and
comrades bowed them down with grief; for they necessarily lacked as
yet the professional training and stoicism of men whose real business
is war.</p>

<p>This exhibition of natural feeling only excited in me a deeper
admiration for the splendid courage and endurance they had displayed
when unsustained and unassisted by the influence of that iron
discipline which only a long course of military training can
inculcate. They were urged only by the spirit of <span class="italic">noblesse oblige</span>,
and the higher ideals which inspire all who have taken up arms against
the Germans in this war.</p>

<p class="p2">On November 2nd, the 16th French Corps and Conneau's French Cavalry
Division were holding the Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge, with a
detachment of our 1st Cavalry Division supporting Conneau.</p>

<p>The troops who had fought so well on the 1st were absolutely tired
out. They had suffered tremendous casualties and could not be counted
on for the moment even as a reserve. They were withdrawn to rest and
refit.</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that the French troops were able to
maintain themselves on the ridge. The Germans were very active, and
the fight constantly swayed backwards and forwards. The western edge
of the plateau and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> outskirts of the villages marked the
extreme limit of the Allied advance line.</p>

<p>For some days I had felt considerable anxiety as to the condition of
the 1st Corps (1st and 2nd Divisions and the 7th Division).</p>

<p>I had constant messages from Haig asking that his tired troops might
be given some rest after all their hard work; but I was driven almost
to my wits' end to find means of giving him the relief he sought. His
Chief of Staff (John Gough) came to my advanced Headquarters at
<span lang="fr">Bailleul</span> and discussed the subject fully with me.</p>

<p>I thought perhaps Foch might be able to help me; but when I went to
interview him he said that, whilst the present crisis lasted, he could
not spare a single man for this purpose. All I could do was to send
two very tired brigades of the 2nd Corps up to Ypres on the morning of
the 5th to relieve the 7th Division, who then came back into billets
round Locre in a shattered condition.</p>

<p>The next day the remainder of the 2nd Corps (which was resting)
followed to Ypres to afford what further relief was possible to the
1st Corps. The 2nd Corps was now scattered in detachments along the
whole line, and the only reserves available were two or three lately
arrived Territorial Battalions and the worn-out 7th Division, reduced
to less than a brigade in strength.</p>

<p>Willcocks about this time felt anxiety as to the line his Indian
troops were holding, and sent his Chief of Staff to me at <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span> to
ask if he could be reinforced. Under the conditions then existing, I
was most anxious that the Indian Corps should hold its own without
assistance and, after calling into consultation other officers of
great Indian experience, I refused to do so, pointing out that he had
four battalions of the 2nd Corps in close reserve behind him.</p>

<p>My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> faith in the Indian troops was justified, and a day or two
later he reported that the Indians were doing well and that he was
full of confidence in them.</p>

<p>On the night of the 3rd, I issued two Special Orders of the Day to the
troops.</p>

<p>They ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Special Order of the Day.</span></p>

<p>"By Field-Marshal Sir John French, <abbr title="Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath">G.C.B.</abbr>, <abbr title="Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order">G.C.V.O.</abbr>, <abbr title="Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George">K.C.M.G.</abbr>,
Commander-in-Chief, British Army in the Field.</p>

<p>"1. The sphere of operations over which the British Army in France has
been operating is now much contracted and rendered more compact. Since
October 21st it has been possible to keep a considerable force in
general reserve.</p>

<p>"2. For several days past the enemy's activities against our front
have been sensibly slackened, and it is quite possible that we may
have entered upon the last stage of the great battle in which we have
been engaged since October 11th.</p>

<p>"At this moment I am anxious to address a few words to the splendid
troops I have the great honour to command.</p>

<p>"In view of the magnificent way in which the troops of the British
Army have fought, the hardships they have had to endure, and the heavy
losses they have suffered, it is right that all ranks, collectively
and individually, should form a just and reasonable conception of the
general situation and the object which we are endeavouring to attain.</p>

<p>"3. It is necessary for this purpose to realise in the first place the
true limits of the theatre of war as a whole, and then to take a
comprehensive view of the entire course of operations as they have
proceeded up to the present moment, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> in order to estimate the
value of the results attained.</p>

<p>"4. It must clearly be understood that the operations in which we have
been engaged embrace nearly all the Continent of Central Europe from
East to West. The combined French, Belgian and British Armies in the
West and the Russian Army in the East are opposed to the united forces
of Germany and Austria acting as a combined Army between us.</p>

<p>"Our enemies elected at the outset of the war to throw the weight of
their forces against the Armies in the West, and to detach only a
comparatively weak force, composed of very few first-line troops and
several Corps of the second and third line, to stem the Russian
advance until the Western forces would be completely defeated and
overwhelmed.</p>

<p>"5. The strength of our enemies enabled them from the outset to throw
greatly superior forces against us in the West. This precluded the
possibility of our taking a vigorous offensive, except when the
miscalculations and mistakes made by their Commanders opened up
special opportunities for a successful attack and pursuit.</p>

<p>"The Battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span> was an example of this, as was also our
advance from <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> and Hazebrouck to the line of the Lys at the
commencement of this battle. The <span class="italic">rôle</span> which our Armies in the West
have consequently been called upon to fulfil has been to occupy strong
defensive positions, holding the ground gained and inviting the
enemy's attack; to throw these attacks back, causing the enemy heavy
losses in his retreat, and following him up with powerful and
successful counter-attacks to complete his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"6. While we have been thus engaged, the Russian Armies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> in
the East, numbering some three to four millions of men, have had time
to mobilise and concentrate their immense forces scattered over all
parts of their vast Empire. Our Eastern Allies have already inflicted
a series of crushing defeats on the Austro-German forces, and are now
rapidly advancing on East Prussia and Silesia in great strength.</p>

<p>"7. The value and significance of the splendid <span class="italic">rôle</span> fulfilled since
the commencement of hostilities by the Allied Forces in the West lies
in the fact that at the moment when the Eastern Provinces of Germany
are about to be overrun by the numerous and powerful Armies of Russia,
nearly the whole of the active army of Germany is tied down to a line
of trenches extending from the Fortress of <span lang="fr">Verdun</span> on the Alsatian
frontier round to the sea at Nieuport, east of Dunkirk (a distance of
260 miles), where they are held, much reduced in numbers and <span class="italic">morale</span>,
by the successful action of our troops in the West.</p>

<p>"8. What the enemy will now do we cannot tell. Should they attempt to
withdraw their troops to strengthen their weakened forces in the East,
we must follow them up and harass their retreat to the utmost of our
power. If they make further futile attempts to break through our
lines, they must be again thrown back with greater and greater loss.</p>

<p>"The Armies of Russia are at their Eastern gates and will very soon be
devastating their country and overthrowing their Armies.</p>

<p>"The great fight which you have so splendidly maintained against
superior numbers in the Western theatre will be decided and completed
by our brave Allies in the East, and I think that we on this side have
reason to hope that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> we have completed the most severe and
arduous part of our task.</p>

<p>"We must, however, be prepared for all eventualities, and I feel sure
no effort will be relaxed to meet with the same undaunted front any
situation, however unexpected, which may arise.</p>

<p>"9. I have made many calls upon you, and the answers you have made to
them have covered you, your regiments, and the Army to which you
belong, with honour and glory.</p>

<p>"Your fighting qualities, courage and endurance have been subjected to
the most trying and severe tests, and you have proved yourselves
worthy descendants of the British soldiers of the past who have built
up the magnificent traditions of the regiments to which you belong.</p>

<p>"You have not only maintained those traditions, but you have
materially added to their lustre.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for me to find words to express my appreciation of
the splendid services you have performed.</p>

<p><span class="left20">(Signed) <span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap">J. D. P. French</span>, Field-Marshal,</span></span><br>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Special Order of the Day.</span></p>

<p>"By Field-Marshal Sir John French, <abbr title="Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath">G.C.B.</abbr>, <abbr title="Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order">G.C.V.O.</abbr>,<br>
  "<abbr title="Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George">K.C.M.G.</abbr>, Commander-in-Chief, British Army in the Field.<br>
<span class="left50">"General Headquarters,</span><br>
<span class="left60">"November 2nd, 1914.</span></p>

<p>"The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief has watched with the deepest
admiration and solicitude the splendid stand made by the soldiers of
His Majesty the King in their successful effort to maintain the
forward position which they have won by their gallantry and
steadfastness.</p>

<p>"He believes that no other Army in the world would show <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> such
tenacity, especially under the tremendous artillery fire directed
against it.</p>

<p>"Its courage and endurance are beyond all praise. It is an honour to
belong to such an Army.</p>

<p>"The Field-Marshal has to make one more call upon the troops. It is
certainly only a question of a few days, and it may be of only a few
hours, before, if they only stand firm, strong support will come, the
enemy will be driven back, and in his retirement will suffer at their
hands losses even greater than those which have befallen him under the
terrific blows by which, especially during the last few days, he has
been repulsed.</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief feels sure that he does not make his call in
vain.</p>

<p><span class="left20">(Signed) <span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap">J. D. P. French</span>, Field-Marshal,</span></span><br>

<span class="left40">"The British Army in the Field."</span></p>

<p>During the early days of November, strong French reinforcements began
to reach Ypres. The 20th French Corps detrained in that area on the
4th and 5th.</p>

<p>It was about this time that both our Intelligence Departments and that
of the French became very optimistic on the subject of a great
withdrawal of the Germans from the Western Front. The Russians were
going on from one success to another, and large entrainments of German
troops were reported at <span lang="fr">Roulers, Thourout, Tourcoing</span>, and other
places.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been really going on, our hopes were, as usual,
doomed to disappointment, for the pressure on our front became greater
and greater. But our eyes were always turned towards the East, and, as
I have explained in a former chapter, the Russian "Will-o'-the Wisp"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> continued to uphold us and keep our eyes centred upon it.</p>

<p>Several Territorial units now began to be landed in France, amongst
others the Artists' Rifles, the Honourable Artillery Company, the
Queen's Westminsters and Hertfordshire Territorials, and the
Warwickshire Battery of Horse Artillery. I spent a morning riding
about amongst them, and was deeply impressed by the wonderful spirit
which pervaded them. The only thought they had was to prepare
themselves in the shortest possible time to take their part in the
fighting at the front.</p>

<p>The Hertfordshire Battalion was commanded by an old friend of mine,
whom I can never think of as other than "Tom Brand," under which
patronymic I had served with him for a long time both in peace and
war, and learnt his great soldierlike qualities. By this time,
however, he had succeeded his father, the famous Speaker of the House
of Commons, and had become Viscount Hampden. I watched him at the time
of which I am writing exercising to the full the power, which he
possessed in an extraordinary degree, of instilling the real fighting
spirit in the men he commanded and afterwards led with such great
skill and gallantry.</p>

<p>It was a power which he possessed in common with his intimate friend,
Lord Cavan, who fought for a long time side by side with him in
France. These two men bore a strong resemblance to one another in the
marvellous influence they seemed to exercise over those under them.
Both men struck me very much. Lord Cavan, like Hampden, was "a
dug-out" and commanded first a brigade and then a division of the
Guards, until he was selected for the command of an Army Corps, with
the utmost gallantry and success.</p>

<p>Closely <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> associated with my early recollections of the
Territorials in France is the Artists' Rifles. They were, before the
war, classified, with some few others, as an Officers' Training Corps.
Our losses in officers in the campaign up to then had been prodigious,
and I was trying to devise some means to fill up their ranks. What I
saw of the Artists' Rifles and the men of which the Corps was
composed, induced me to think of turning them to this purpose.</p>

<p>They were commanded by a most valuable and efficient officer, Colonel
May. Him I consulted about it, and with his help an Officers' Training
School was established, which was the first of many which have since
sprung into existence. The Artists' Rifles were instrumental in
quickly meeting some of our pressing needs in this important respect,
and may be said to have laid the foundation of that Officers' School
of War whose ramifications were soon to extend not only behind all the
fighting lines, but throughout the United Kingdom. It is interesting
to recall the fact that the conversion of certain picked Territorial
battalions into Officers' Training Corps before the war was another of
Lord Haldane's brilliant conceptions.</p>

<p class="p2">Some fine work was done on the evening of the 6th by Kavanagh's 7th
Cavalry Brigade, Cavan's 4th Guards Brigade and Lawford's 22nd Brigade
of the 7th Division. Moncey's detachment of French troops, posted on
the right of the 1st Corps, had been driven back over the canal, and a
serious position was created.</p>

<p>Our troops counter-attacked with great effect, Lawford's Brigade (2nd
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> The Queen's, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Warwickshire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Welsh
Fusiliers, and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Staffs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>) capturing a good many
prisoners and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> machine guns. The counter-attack was
successful, and the situation was restored.</p>

<p>We paid dearly for this success, however, in the loss of some very
valuable lives. Amongst others Gordon Wilson, commanding the Blues,
and Hugh Dawnay, commanding the 2nd Life Guards, were killed. Wilson
was an excellent cavalry leader. He had done splendid work with the
3rd Cavalry Division ever since they landed, and his death left a big
gap.</p>

<p>Up to three or four days before his death, Hugh Dawnay had been my
liaison officer with the 1st Corps. The occasion of his going back to
his regiment arose in this way. The 2nd Life Guards were getting very
weak in officers, and he had an idea that he ought to be with them. He
felt this very deeply, and told me so in a conversation we had
together on the subject. The first time he spoke to me about it I told
him that, whilst I sympathised with all he said, yet I considered it
was his duty to remain where he was. I reminded him of the highly
important work he was doing so well, and told him that it would be
most difficult to replace him in that work, whereas it would be
comparatively easy to put his regiment right as regards officers.</p>

<p>The next day he came back to me and repeated his request with great
earnestness. He told me he could never be happy or contented in his
mind if at this juncture he did not take his place beside his brother
officers in his old regiment. It would indeed have been difficult for
any soldier to refuse such a request, or fail to understand and enter
into Dawnay's feelings.</p>

<p>I felt that it was weak of me to give way to him, but I did so on the
understanding that his absence was only to be temporary. Of course, he
might easily have been killed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> in the performance of his
Staff duties, nevertheless when I heard he had fallen I felt that, in
the interests of the service, I had done wrong in allowing him to go.</p>

<p>It is necessary to steel one's heart against any kind of sentiment
when conducting a great war, and in the loss of one of the finest and
most valuable young Staff Officers I have ever come across, I learnt a
lesson never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>On several subsequent occasions similar requests were made to me
without avail, notably in the case of my friend Clive of the
Grenadiers, whose services and help I can never recall without
admiration and gratitude.</p>

<p>On the night of the 6th came the information that the Austrians had
been badly routed and driven across the San river by the Russians. Up
went our hopes again like quick-silver; another week gone and we
expected to see the Germans on our front weakened and reduced by the
necessity of sending troops to save Silesia.</p>

<p>Our hopes and plans were fully discussed at a meeting held on Sunday,
November 8th, at Foch's Headquarters at <span lang="fr">Cassel</span>. Foch was in one of his
most sanguine moods, and I must confess to having strongly felt the
infection of his hopeful disposition. Our military barometer, however,
went up and down as swiftly and suddenly as that of a ship in a
typhoon.</p>

<p>What filled my immediate thoughts was the dire necessity of relieving
the tired-out troops in the Ypres salient, and this was the point I
impressed most strongly upon Foch who, it seemed to me, found it
difficult to talk of anything but "<span class="italic" lang="fr">Attaque! Attaque! Attaque!</span>"</p>

<p>He gave me some help in this matter; indeed, as much as he could, I
feel sure, but not before most of those gallant troops were called
upon to withstand the new and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> terrible onslaught which I
shall describe in the next chapter.</p>

<p>On the 9th we received the following gracious message from His Majesty
the King:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="left10">"To Sir John French,</span><br>
<span class="left20">"Expeditionary Force.</span>
<span class="col55">November 9th, 1914.</span></p>

<p>"The splendid pluck, spirit and endurance shown by my troops in the
desperate fighting which has continued for so many days against vastly
superior forces fills me with admiration. I am confident in the final
results of their noble efforts under your able command.</p>

<p class="left50">"GEORGE, <abbr title="Kimg and Emperor">R.I.</abbr>"</p>


<p>The following reply was sent:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="left10">"To His Majesty the King,</span><br>
<span class="left20">"Buckingham Palace,</span><br>
<span class="left30">"London.</span>

<p>"Your Majesty's most gracious message has been received by the

uphold the highest traditions of Your Majesty's Army and carry the
campaign through to a victorious end.</p>

<p class="left50">"FRENCH."</p>

<p>Throughout the phase of the battle narrated in this chapter, fighting
went on with varying success all along the line from <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> to the
sea. Ploegsteert Wood was the scene of many violent engagements. The
6th Division and 19th Brigade to the south were constantly at grips
with the enemy. All along the valley of the <span lang="fr">Douve</span> and the
Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge the enemy was continuously active. But the
point in the line which caused me the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> greatest anxiety was
the dent between the 1st (British) and the 16th (French) Corps at the
canal to the north of Hollebeke. It is not too much to say that only
by the display of the greatest gallantry and endurance on the part of
the 3rd Cavalry Division and the other troops engaged at that point
was the enemy prevented from getting dangerously near our
communications.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span></h3>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF YPRES</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="italic">Fourth and Final Phase, November 11th to the end of the Battle</span></p>

<p>Each of the four phases into which I have divided this very brief and
incomplete narrative of the Battle of Ypres is marked by one important
and far-reaching crisis.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the battle came the arrest of the German advance
on the Channel ports, and the brilliant repulse of the enemy back to
the Lys by the cavalry under Allenby and the 3rd Corps under Pulteney.
The second phase is distinguished by the crisis of October 31st, while
in the third phase occurs the memorable stand of the cavalry and other
troops under Allenby on the Wytschaete&mdash;<span lang="fr">Messines</span> ridge.</p>

<p>The great feature of the fourth and last phase was the desperate
assaults made against the Ypres salient on the 11th and 12th November,
in which the flower of the Prussian Guard participated, having
received the Emperor's personal command to make certain of finally
breaking our line.</p>

<p>It was in the same conference room at <span lang="fr">Cassel</span> in which I had been with
Foch on the 8th, and where, as I have said, we mutually indulged in
day-dreams of imminent victory, that, on the evening of November 10th,
I received the reports which warned me that another great crisis was
at hand.</p>

<p>Foch <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> informed me that an attack on a great scale had just
begun against his line between Ypres and the sea. He had received
reliable reports that the enemy had brought up five fresh corps from
the south. He said that the Germans had already gained possession of
the village of Dixmude, but had not yet crossed the Yser, which French
Marines and Belgians were holding against them. He added that he was
being heavily pressed and was losing ground near Langemarck, and
declared that he must move Conneau's Cavalry Division (holding the
line opposite <span lang="fr">Messines</span>) north to support him, and he asked me to put
Allenby in to relieve Conneau. I agreed to this, and gave orders
accordingly.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 11th, Haig reported that his position was
being heavily shelled, and that he was threatened with a powerful
attack. Two fresh German Army Corps had come up in his front, namely,
the Guard and the <abbr title="15">XV</abbr>th.</p>

<p>In short, the Germans were about to deliver their final desperate
blow, which they hoped and believed would at last open up to them the
road to the sea.</p>

<p>The situation was met by Haig with the same grim determination,
steadfast courage and skilful forethought which had characterised his
handling of the operations throughout. A volume might easily be
written of this day's fighting of November 11th, but it is only
possible in these pages to glance at the particular points in the line
of battle where the fighting was fiercest, and where the issues were
most vital at different hours of the day.</p>

<p>Up the <span lang="fr">Menin</span> road came the first tremendous onslaught at 9.30 a.m. on
the front held by the 1st (Guards), 7th, and 15th Brigades. At the
first clash of arms the Germans pierced our line with a rush. This was
splendidly disputed by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> the Royal Fusiliers under McMahon,
their devoted and gallant leader, who was killed; while the battalion
was almost annihilated. Reserves, however, quickly came up,
counter-attacks were organised and delivered, and the line was
re-established.</p>

<p>About noon the critical point changed to the right at the canal, where
the French were driven out of their trenches and fell back on
Verbranden Molen. General Vidal called on our 1st Corps for support
and help. The heavy fighting in the neighbourhood of the <span lang="fr">Menin</span> road
had used up most of his reserves, and the enemy were still clinging to
the woods in that part of the line and threatening renewed attacks;
but, in spite of this, Haig was able to render the French sufficient
help to enable them to make a little headway, though the situation in
this part of the line was in doubt and caused anxiety all day.</p>

<p>About 1.30 p.m. a fresh attack of great violence was delivered further
north against the 5th Brigade. This was thrown back mainly by our
artillery fire.</p>

<p>About 3 p.m. the enemy began to mass in the woods about the <span lang="fr">Menin</span>
road, near the centre of our line. On attempting to advance, however,
they were caught between two fires, from the north-east and
south-west, the Oxfordshire <abbr title="Light-Infantry">L.I.</abbr> and the Northamptons turning them out
of the woods at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>Severe fighting went on till nightfall, units becoming much
intermixed. The losses were very heavy indeed, the 1st (Guards)
Brigade mustering at night only four officers and 300 men.</p>

<p>The final result of this magnificent defence was that the attack was
repulsed with terrible loss to the enemy, and the original line
practically held throughout, save for the loss of some few and
unimportant trenches.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> FitzClarence, <abbr title="Victoria Cross">V.C.</abbr>, to whom reference has
already been made, was killed. His name has justly become famous for
many gallant deeds, but more particularly in connection with the
crisis of October 31st.</p>

<p>The success of this great defence, like those which preceded it, was
due in the first place to the quick grasp of the situation by Sir
Douglas Haig, who so skilfully handled the scanty forces at his
disposal, and economised his few reserves with such soldierlike
foresight. Mutual support at critical moments was ensured by the
wholehearted co-operation of commanders of all units, great and small.</p>

<p>No words can express my sense of the gratitude which the country owes
to the young officers, to the non-commissioned officers, and to the
rank and file of this invincible army. When all has been said, it was
their courage and endurance which spoke the last word.</p>

<p>Whilst we were thus fully occupied about the <span lang="fr">Menin</span> road, the French
were also being attacked all along their line to the north of Ypres,
but the enemy was held off.</p>

<p>In accordance with the arrangements made with Foch, the Cavalry Corps
took over the line opposite <span lang="fr">Messines</span> on the morning of the 11th, when
Conneau's cavalry marched north. Allenby was reinforced by two
battalions of the 8th Division, these battalions being replaced by two
Territorial battalions.</p>

<p>In the evening de Lisle's (1st) Cavalry Division was sent to reinforce
Haig, to whom were also dispatched the Hertfordshire Territorial
battalion and two yeomanry regiments from <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>.</p>

<p>The situation north of Hollebeke at the canal (which the Germans had
now crossed) was a source of much anxiety to me, and I made strong
representations to Foch <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> as to the necessity of strengthening
his troops at that important point. He promised to reinforce Vidal at
once with three battalions of <span lang="fr">chasseurs</span>.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th, Field-Marshal Lord Roberts arrived at my
Headquarters on a visit, accompanied by his daughter, Lady Aileen (now
Countess) Roberts. It is needless to say with what enthusiasm the
Field-Marshal was welcomed everywhere.</p>

<p>The martial fire, which was the life-long characteristic of this great
soldier, burnt as brightly within him during these last few days of
his life as when he earned his Victoria Cross on the eastern
battlefields over 60 years before. His presence, particularly at this
critical time, in the midst of the army he loved so well&mdash;love which
they returned to the full&mdash;acted as a timely inspiration and incentive
to our weary and hard-pressed troops.</p>

<p>That the tremendous energy of the great soldier remained unimpaired to
the last was proved to me on the night of his arrival. He dined at my
Headquarters' mess, and after dinner I had a long conversation with
him on the situation. It was getting late, and I suggested that, as he
had a hard day before him on the morrow, he should go to his quarters
and get some rest.</p>

<p>He asked me when I generally got to bed. I told him that I took rest
when I could, but never knew exactly when it would be possible. I
added as an example of this that a conference was fixed for that night
between 12 and 1 o'clock, when we hoped all the reports would be in.
Nothing that I urged could dissuade him from remaining up and
attending that conference, which he followed with his usual clearness
of mind and acute perception, although it lasted into the small hours
of the morning.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> early dawn of the next day saw him perfectly fresh, going
out to visit his beloved Indians.</p>

<p>On the evening of Friday the 13th the Field-Marshal was suddenly taken
very ill on his return home from visiting troops in the front, and he
died on Saturday, the 14th, at about 8 p.m.</p>

<p>On the morning of Tuesday, November 17th, a military funeral service
was held at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>, which was attended by everyone who could get
there. Generals Foch and <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span> represented the French Army. The
Indian Princes attached to the Indian Corps were also present, and the
Maharajah Sir Pertab Singh took his place on the motor hearse and
acted as a personal guard over the remains of the great chief on his
last sad journey to England.</p>

<p>General <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span> paid an impressive tribute to the dead
Field-Marshal in the following General Order which he issued to the
10th Army, dated November 16th, 1914.</p>

<p class="center p2">"<span class="italic">General Order <abbr title="Number">No</abbr> 44.</span></p>

<p>"Lord Roberts, Field-Marshal in the British Army, died yesterday at
General Headquarters of the British Army.</p>

<p>"The illustrious conqueror of Afghanistan and South Africa had come,
in spite of his great age, to visit the battlefields where at the
present time his valiant soldiers are fighting. Up to the moment when
death struck him down, he pursued the object to which he devoted his
whole life, the greatness of England.</p>

<p>"The General Commanding the 10th Army is voicing the feeling of all
ranks under his command, both officers and men alike, when he says to
Marshal French and to the General Officer Commanding the Indian Corps,
that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> 10th Army fully shares in the mourning of our Allies
to-day.</p>

<p>"May the example afforded by the famous British Marshal up to the end
be understood and felt by us all. Lord Roberts has died in an hour of
mighty battles, in the midst of the troops which he loved so well. No
end can be more enviable, none more glorious for a soldier.</p>

<p class="left50">(Signed) <span class="add2em">"<span class="smcap" lang="fr">de Maud'huy.</span>"</span></p>

<p>During the 12th the enemy attempted renewed attacks on either flank of
the 1st Corps, but was repulsed with great loss. Although the troops
holding the Ypres salient were hard pressed and got little rest until
they were relieved by the French, still it may be said that these
attacks were practically the last of the really determined and nearly
successful efforts made by the Germans during the First Battle of
Ypres.</p>

<p>The French were able to retake some of the ground they had lost,
although the enemy still held on to Dixmude.</p>

<p>From November 12th onwards, the chief anxiety I had was to get relief
and rest for the troops which had been fighting so desperately in the
Ypres salient, particularly the 1st Corps. I had long interviews with
Foch, and represented to him the necessity for French troops to take
over the whole of the ground there, at any rate for a time. At first
he said there would be a great difficulty in doing this; but finally
he promised to meet my wishes and agreed to start carrying out the
relief on Sunday, the 15th, at latest.</p>

<p>On this I told Haig that no more troops would be sent to him, but that
he would be gradually withdrawn into reserve as he was relieved by
French troops. The 1st Corps troops were to be withdrawn before any
others, and brought into reserve as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Foch was as good as his word. On the night of the 15th, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> the
French 9th Corps took over some of Haig's trenches and released two
brigades of the 1st Division, as well as some artillery. These all
came into reserve on the 16th at Locre and Westoutre.</p>

<p>On the 13th our front on the Ypres salient was heavily shelled from 10
a.m., and infantry attacks commenced at 1 p.m. up the <span lang="fr">Menin</span> road and
against the 6th and 7th Brigades (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> The King's (Liverpool)
<abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Staffs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Berks <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
<abbr title="Kings Royal Rifle">K.R.R.</abbr> and 3rd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Worcester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>; 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Lancs, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Wilts <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, and 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Irish Rifles). The latter had their line
broken, but it was restored by a counter-attack. The enemy lost
heavily.</p>

<p>Heavy attacks were made early on the 14th against the 9th Brigade (1st
<abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Northumberland Fusiliers, 4th <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Fusiliers, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Lincs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr> and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Scots Fusiliers) in the same area, and
later these developed along the whole front, but the Germans were
everywhere driven back.</p>

<p>On the 15th the Indian Corps became heavily engaged between
<span lang="fr">Armentières</span> and <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span>. Some trenches were lost and regained during
the day, and the enemy made no progress.</p>

<p>On the early morning of this day a very gallant piece of work was
carried out on our Ypres front by a storming party which was led by
<abbr title="Company-sergeant-major">Co.-Sergt.-Major</abbr> Gibbon of the 5th <abbr title="battalion">Battn.</abbr> Northumberland Fusiliers. On
the previous evening the enemy had gained possession of some buildings
within our line. A gun was brought up by a cleverly-concealed route to
the closest range, the buildings were battered down and our position
restored at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>On the 17th the Ypres salient was again the scene of heavy
encounters. There was severe fighting, but we had a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> very
successful day, inflicting great loss on the enemy south of the <span lang="fr">Menin</span>
road.</p>

<p>The 21st marked the end of the Battle of Ypres, and I had the
satisfaction of seeing our troops completely evacuate the Ypres
salient. The whole of the 1st Corps and the cavalry were in reserve.
The fourteen battalions of the 2nd Corps, which had been moved up to
support the 1st Corps in the north, marched to rejoin their Corps
north of <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">I cannot close the narrative of this great battle without particularly
emphasising the part which was played by the 1st Corps. They were
thrown in suddenly to fill up the gap through which the Germans were
preparing to pour in troops in order to seize the Channel seaboard.
They were called upon to advance and make good their ground in the
teeth of numbers three or four times their own strength and against a
much more powerful artillery. For five weeks they fought day and night
continuously against vastly superior forces, and against artillery
always far above their own in strength and numbers.</p>

<p>In the great campaigns of the past we find special units singled out
and handed down to fame, such as "The Light Division" under Crawford
in the Peninsular War or "The Brandenburg Corps" under Prince
Frederick Charles of Prussia in the Franco-German War of 1870. I think
we may rest assured that history will label the 1st British Corps in
this war with some such distinguished sobriquet. Well and truly did
they earn it.</p>

<p>I append the record of the losses of the 1st Corps in the battle up
to November 21st, when they were relieved. It speaks more eloquently
than any words of mine of the great <span class="italic">rôle</span> it played in this
tremendous struggle.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="14">XIV</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span></h3>

<h4>THE ENTRY OF THE TERRITORIAL ARMY</h4>


<p>On November 16th the Prince of Wales joined the Army in the Field. It
was the first time since the days of the Black Prince that the Heir
Apparent to the Throne had taken the field in war. His Royal Highness
was received by the troops with delight and acclamation. The courage,
devotion and endurance which he has since displayed on active service
have secured him the love and admiration of every officer,
non-commissioned officer and man of His Majesty's Army, and his name
will descend in history, bright with the honour which he won in the
field.</p>

<p>Early in the month a certain amount of heavy artillery began to arrive
in France. Special positions were selected and prepared all along the
front, and the few guns we had were interchanged between them as
occasion required.</p>

<p>It was from such crude beginnings that we reached the wonderful
developments in the use of heavy artillery which have been witnessed
during the progress of the war. It is of some interest to compare the
number of 6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> guns and over which we had at that time, with the
number which were deployed on the same front later in the war.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the First Battle of Ypres the weather was
very wet and stormy. The rain gave place to cold northerly winds, and
on the afternoon of November 19th there was a heavy fall of snow. That
evening a hard frost set in which lasted for several days. The men in
the trenches began to suffer severely.</p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> was at this time, the third week of November, 1914, that
the serious evil known as "Trench Feet" first made its appearance in
the Army in France. The cases were at first labelled "Frost Bite," but
as they were subsequently found to occur without any fall of the
temperature to freezing point, this term was evidently a misnomer.
Indeed, cases have occurred during the month of August.</p>

<p>The condition is caused by prolonged immersion in water, and certainly
can occur when the temperature of the water is as high as 50°<abbr title="fahrenheit">F.</abbr> It is
seldom caused unless the immersion is as long as 24 hours, but the
cooler the water the less is the time required to produce it. In most
cases the temperature of the water has been below 40°.</p>

<p>In addition to cold water, the onset is favoured by&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>(<span class="italic">a</span>) Prolonged standing in one position, as is often the case
     with men deep in mud.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">b</span>) Tight puttees and tight boots.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">c</span>) Exhaustion and want of food.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">d</span>) A natural tendency to feeble circulation, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, men who
     suffer from chilblains.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">e</span>) Lying out, after being wounded, in wet and cold weather.</li>
</ul>

<p>The condition observed varies very much according to the severity of
the case:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>(<span class="italic">a</span>) The feet may be merely very painful and tender.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">b</span>) Much more often they are very swollen and cold, with but
     little feeling in them.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">c</span>) Frequently the whole foot is like a big "chilblain" and is
     very hot, red and swollen. <span class="italic">Blisters</span> are common in all such
     feet.</li>
<li>(<span class="italic">d</span>) The toes may be black and the foot blue.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span> (<span class="italic">e</span>) The toes especially, and the foot much more
     rarely, may die and become gangrenous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Except in slight cases, the men affected are quite unfit for duty for
two or three months at least, especially for duty in trenches in cold
weather. If men are sent back to duty too soon, a short exposure at
once brings back all the trouble in an aggravated form. Of course, if
gangrene occurs, the man is permanently invalided.</p>

<p>The only <span class="italic">real</span> preventative is to arrange that the men do not remain
deep in mud or cold water for prolonged periods. If this is not
possible, cases of "trench feet" are inevitable. Apart from avoiding
this, the primary cause, various subsidiary causes can be guarded
against; and, from the experience gained in dealing with the
condition, the following instructions were formulated and communicated
to the officers in charge of the men:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Boots and puttees should not fit tightly and must be taken
     off once <span class="italic">at least</span> every 24 hours and the feet well rubbed and
     cleaned, dry socks put on.</li>
<li>(2) The feet should be kept as clean as possible so as to avoid
     septic complications in case of blistering.</li>
<li>(3) <span class="italic">Rubber thigh-boots</span> should be supplied to all men in
     waterlogged trenches, and these should be large enough to take
     two pairs of socks.</li>
<li>(4) Trench-boards should be provided, or brushwood or straw laid
     down.</li>
<li>(5) Men should be kept dry by the use of mackintosh over the
     shoulders.</li>
<li>(6) Hot food should be supplied whenever this is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is, of course, evident that all these precautions are often quite
unobtainable. In the Ypres region in the winter <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> of 1914-1915
many men stood for days and nights up to the middle in water, and some
of the communication trenches were impassable because of the depth of
the water. Indeed, a good many men were drowned.</p>

<p>The treatment varies with the severity of the case. Rest with the feet
up and careful washing of the feet is all that is at first needed in
slight cases. If there are blisters or sores these must be treated.
Later on various forms of electrical treatment and massage are of use.
In all but slight cases treatment does not prevent the man being
unable to walk for many weeks without pain.</p>

<p>The number of men invalided for "trench feet" during the winter of
1914-1915 was over 20,000. The 27th Division lost 3,000 men the first
week they were in the trenches in February. With good trenches and
proper care "trench feet" should be of rare occurrence. If under these
conditions they are numerous, someone is to blame. As a result of the
experience gained during the winter of 1914-1915 and the adoption of
the recommendations issued, in the winters 1915-1917, in the Ypres
salient, the "trench feet" cases did not average more than two a day
in an army of over 200,000 men.</p>

<p class="p2">It was in the closing days of the First Battle of Ypres that the bulk
of the Territorial troops sent to France at that time entered the
fighting line.</p>

<p>In the course of a telegram which I received from Lord Kitchener on
November 2nd, the Secretary of State for War said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The total number of Territorial Battalions in France and ordered
there is 19. I am selecting two more to make up one per Brigade."</p>

<p>These arrangements had been made in response to my urgent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> requests that whatever Territorial regiments of yeomanry or
battalions of infantry were ready and available should be sent to
France at once and incorporated with the regular forces there, and
that we should not wait for the divisional formations to be prepared
and completed.</p>

<p>The history of the Territorials is well known. The Volunteers, from
which the Territorial Army sprang, came into being in the years just
following the Crimean War.</p>

<p>For some 10 to 20 years afterwards the Volunteers may be said to have
met with little better than derision. It was said that they only
wanted to wear a uniform and play at soldiers, and hardly anyone
believed in the wonderful spirit which really animated them from the
start. The military and other authorities gave them but little help
and hardly any encouragement, in fact they refused to take the
Volunteers seriously.</p>

<p>In spite of all these drawbacks this wonderful force, under the
leadership of such men as the late Lord Wemyss, Lord MacDonald, and
others, went steadily on, struggling against adversity, but increasing
in strength all the time. The great patriotic spirit which has always
been the soul of the Volunteers, was kept alive by their great leaders
in face of slights and neglect, but it was reserved for Lord Haldane
to devise the scheme which was to make the fullest use of the
Volunteers and bring them to the zenith of their reputation. He
realised that their patriotic ardour might be put to good purpose, and
drafted the scheme whereby, whilst remaining volunteers, they were
formed into a great Territorial Army, administered by the so-called
Territorial County Associations, to whose energy and devotion the
country owes so much.</p>

<p>The result of Lord Haldane's statesmanlike foresight has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span>
been clear to anyone who, during the past four years, has cast his
eyes across the Channel and seen the splendid behaviour of our citizen
soldiers in the field.</p>

<p>I have spoken already elsewhere of what I have always regarded as our
great initial administrative mistake in the war, namely, the raising
of an entirely new Army, when the machinery for expanding the
Territorial Force&mdash;especially established by Lord Haldane for the
purpose&mdash;I mean the Territorial County Associations&mdash;was already at
hand and would have proved by far the most efficient and economical
method of raising the troops required.</p>

<p>Lord MacDonald and those who are left of the early Volunteer soldiers
must, in their old age, rejoice in the knowledge that they have lived
to see the force, which they tended and nurtured against such
appalling difficulties, actually for several months standing between
the Empire and disaster.</p>

<p>Such a spirit as that which the Volunteers cultivated and maintained
is bound sooner or later to make itself felt, and, as the years rolled
on, the country came at last dimly and slowly to realise the
Volunteers' true value. They figured in the field as early as 1882 in
the Egyptian Campaign, and played their part afterwards in much
greater numbers throughout the South African War.</p>

<p>After Lord Kitchener had made his call upon the country for the New
Armies, the Territorials found themselves neglected and put in the
shade.</p>

<p>It is true that by the terms of their engagement, Territorial
soldiers were only available for home defence; but even in peace time
a certain proportion of the force had volunteered to serve anywhere in
case of war, and it was always anticipated that, when the necessity
arose, a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> renewed call would be made upon the whole force to
do likewise. The response to the call which was subsequently made upon
them shows quite clearly that, had they been asked at first, they
would have come forward almost to a man.</p>

<p>However, as it turned out, they were ignored and the call was never
made upon them. Officers and men alike, naturally and inevitably made
up their minds that they were not wanted and would never be used for
any other purpose than that for which they had originally taken
service, namely, the defence of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>But the time for the employment of troops other than the Regulars of
the old Army arrived with drastic and unexpected speed. The wastage of
war proved to be so enormous that the fighting line had to be
reinforced almost before the new Armies were in existence.</p>

<p>It was then that the country in her need turned to the despised
Territorials.</p>

<p>The call came upon them like a bolt from the blue. No warning had been
given. Fathers and sons, husbands and brothers, left families, homes,
the work and business of their lives, almost at an hour's notice to go
on active service abroad.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we have never realised what it was these men were
asked to do. They were quite different to professional soldiers, who
are kept and paid through years of peace for this particular purpose
of war; who spend their lives practising their profession and gaining
promotion and distinction; and who, on being confronted with the
enemy, fulfil the great ambition of their lives.</p>

<p>Equally distinct were the Territorials also from what has been called
the New Army, whose officers and men had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> ample time to
prepare themselves for what they were required to do.</p>

<p>I wonder, sometimes, if the eyes of the country will ever be opened to
what these Territorial soldiers of ours have done.</p>

<p>I say without the slightest hesitation that without the assistance
which the Territorials afforded between October, 1914, and June, 1915,
it would have been impossible to have held the line in France and
Belgium, or to have prevented the enemy from reaching his goal, the
Channel seaboard.</p>

<p>Between the beginning of November and the end of the Battle of Ypres,
Territorial battalions were constantly arriving. A special training
camp was formed for them at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> under a selected commander. This
post was admirably filled first by Brigadier-General Chichester, and
later by Brigadier-General Oxley.</p>

<p>I have already told of the fine work done by the Oxfordshire Hussars
and the London Scottish&mdash;the first Territorials to enter the line of
battle.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6" title="Go to footnote 6"><span class="smaller">[6]</span></a> Their splendid example was well followed, and the record
they established nobly maintained by each unit of the Territorial Army
as it successively took its place in the trenches.</p>

<p>Of these units, the Warwickshire Horse Artillery Battery detrained at
<span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> in the beginning of November. Of the cavalry, the Oxfordshire
Hussars disembarked at Dunkirk about the middle of September; the
Northumberland Hussars came to France in October; the Leicestershire,
North Somerset, Essex and Northampton Regiments <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> of Yeomanry
during November; and the Surrey towards the end of December.</p>

<p>All these units received a course of training in the <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span> camp of
instruction. I often rode amongst them, and was much impressed by the
fine material in men, horses and equipment of which they were
composed, and with the rapid progress which they made.</p>

<p>I knew from my experience as Inspector of Yeomanry a good many years
ago what efforts these Yeomanry Regiments had for a long time made to
live up to the times and render themselves efficient. Although I now
found that the old type of hunting farmer was not so fully represented
in their ranks as formerly, yet a valuable leavening of this class
still remained, and they were for the most part commanded and
officered by county men of position and influence, accustomed to
hunting, polo and field sports.</p>

<p>In a very short time we were able to use the Yeomanry in the front
line. The Oxfordshire, Leicestershire, North Somerset and Essex were
incorporated in brigades of the Cavalry Divisions, and the
Northumberland, Northampton and Surreys were employed as Divisional
Cavalry. The same practical value attached to the Warwickshire Battery
of Horse Artillery, upon which Lord Brooke had expended so much time
and energy for years preceding the war.</p>

<p>Twenty-three battalions of Territorial infantry were sent to France
in 1914. Of these the London Scottish and the infantry battalion of
the Honourable Artillery Company arrived in September. The 5th Border
<abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, Artists' Rifles, 6th Welsh, 5th Black Watch, Queen's
Westminsters, 10th Liverpools (Scottish), 13th London (County of
London), 8th Royal Scots, 9th Highland Light Infantry, 5th Scottish
Rifles, 9th London <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 4th Royal Welsh <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> Fusiliers, 2nd
Monmouths, Hertfordshire, 4th Seaforth Highlanders, 4th Suffolks, 6th
Cheshires, and 6th Gordon Highlanders arrived in November, whilst the
7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 12th London came in
December.</p>

<p>These units were all put through a course of training at <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>.
There was a great difference between individual battalions as regards
their actual condition when they came out, and the time required to
prepare them to take their places in the trenches.</p>

<p>Some were much better commanded and officered than others. There was a
marked distinction to be noted in their physique and quality. But, on
the whole, it may be fairly said that they promised to furnish most
valuable reinforcements to our severely tried army. The energy they
displayed and the progress they made were really wonderful.</p>

<p>As Inspector-General of the Forces between 1908 and 1912, I had
constant opportunities of watching the training of the Territorial
Army in the first years of its existence as such. I was familiar with
the earnest and successful endeavours they had made to profit by the
vastly improved conditions and status secured to them by Lord
Haldane's wise and skilful administration. The same zeal which
characterised them so remarkably as Volunteers was applied in greater
force and with intensified confidence when, as Territorials, they were
organised, commanded, staffed, equipped and trained on sound methods
and up-to-date lines.</p>

<p>All this seven or eight years' experience operated to the greatest
advantage when these Territorial battalions arrived in the theatre of
war and commenced their final preparation to fill the gaps in our
line, through which, as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> I have shown, the Germans must have
penetrated had the Territorial Army not existed to step into the
breach.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Honourable Artillery Company">H.A.C.</abbr> was the first unit to follow the London Scottish. I
inspected them at the front on November 9th&mdash;the day upon which they
joined the Indian Corps&mdash;and they presented a splendid appearance. I
never saw a finer lot of men. They afterwards established a record in
the war which is well worthy of the fine old corps from which they
spring.</p>

<p>The Queen's Westminsters and the 8th Royal Scots only embarked on the
1st and 4th of November respectively, yet their condition was so good
that they were able to be sent to the front immediately after the
<abbr title="Honourable Artillery Company">H.A.C.</abbr></p>

<p>The Queen's Westminsters were sent to the 7th Division to relieve the
Artists' Corps, which then became an Officers' Training Corps.</p>

<p>I saw a great deal of the Hertfordshires during the very few days they
were training at Headquarters, and found them a particularly fine
regiment. Although they only embarked on November 5th, they were at
Ypres in the 1st Corps Reserve ten or eleven days later and before the
end of the battle. The 10th Liverpools have a fine record. They
embarked on November 1st and joined the 9th Brigade on the 25th of the
month south of Wytschaete, where they were in the first line trenches
on the 27th, between the Royal Fusiliers on the left and the 5th
(Northumberland) Fusiliers on the right.</p>

<p>The 9th Highland Light Infantry were incorporated in the 5th Brigade
(2nd Division) on November 24th, about ten days after their arrival in
the country. The 2nd Monmouths, the London Rifle Brigade, and the 5th
Scottish Rifles were incorporated in the 3rd Corps on November 19th,
after some eleven or twelve days in the country.</p>

<p>Many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span> other examples can be quoted to show how quickly these
Territorial troops, following the lead given to them by the
Oxfordshire Hussars and the London Scottish, accustomed themselves to
the severe and trying conditions of war, and of what real value they
were at this critical time.</p>

<p>The inexperience of regimental officers was, of course, the greatest
difficulty we had to contend with when these troops first took the
field. This was a most serious drawback in view of the vastly
increased responsibility which falls upon leaders of all ranks in war
as it is conducted to-day, but they improved beyond all expectation,
and every week found them more efficient.</p>

<p>I have so far spoken of the Territorial Army in regard to its
employment in units of regiments and battalions at a most critical
time in the war, when reinforcements were badly needed. I come now to
the time when, a few months later, they entered into the campaign as
complete divisions.</p>

<p>The great mass of military opinion held that the highest practical
unit in which Territorial soldiers could be organised was the brigade
of four battalions. The regular gunner had no use for Territorial
horse and field artillery. Engineer Volunteers had for some time
existed, but only in small numbers and in particular localities.
Although the Army Service Corps and the Army Medical Corps had for
years been represented in the Volunteer Forces by small units and
detachments, it was never considered that those services could be
efficiently and practically performed by any but "whole-timers."</p>

<p>Backed up by the opinion and advice of a very few soldiers of
experience, the Secretary of State for War cast all this prejudice to
the winds, and determined upon a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> regular and complete
divisional organisation for the Territorials. It was indeed a great
and courageous decision. "What!" exclaimed the gold-bedizened smart
young horse artillery commander, "do you mean to say you are going to
allot Territorial horse artillery batteries to your mounted brigade?
You must be mad! It takes years even to approach the necessary degree
of efficiency."</p>

<p>The field gunner, immersed in his latest developments to ensure the
utmost accuracy of fire, the howitzer and heavy field artillery
expert, the scientific and highly-trained sapper, all joined in the
hue and cry, until Lord Haldane's conceptions almost collapsed and
expired in a ferment of ridicule. But he remained steadfast. The
mounted brigades received their Territorial batteries of horse
artillery. Fourteen complete Territorial divisions were formed of
three brigades of infantry, three brigades of field artillery, one
brigade of howitzers, one brigade of heavies, field and signal
companies of Engineers, companies of Army Service Corps and Army
Medical Corps.</p>

<p>Lord Haldane had only some eight or nine years to wait for his reward.
Within that time he saw his Territorials doing splendid and invaluable
work as complete divisions in the field, and fighting with success
against the most powerful and efficient army in the world. When I say
he "got his reward," I may well be misunderstood. He got nothing but
calumny and grossly unjust abuse; but the "reward" to such a man does
not come in the ordinary way. He had proved the value of his great
work, and that is all the reward he ever wanted.</p>

<p>It is to this organisation that I largely attribute the success of
the Territorials in the field throughout the war. Each unit learned by
degrees its own relative place and position <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> in the great
divisional machine. Enthusiasm was raised in the idea engendered in
all ranks that they formed part of a great engine of war, furnished by
their own counties and immediate neighbourhoods. At first, certainly,
they were crude and untrained, but every day they improved through
instruction, and developed great intelligence under a thorough and
practical exposition of the objects to be aimed at.</p>

<p>The strength of the new arrangement lay chiefly in the fact that each
division was commanded by an experienced general officer of the
regular forces, assisted by a well-selected and competent staff of
regular officers.</p>

<p>Six divisions in all arrived in France between November 3rd, 1914, and
April 30th, 1915, namely, the 46th (North Midland), the 47th (London),
the 48th (South Midland), the 49th (West Riding), the 50th
(Northumbrian), and the 51st (Highland).</p>

<p>A prominent part was taken in the fighting of 1915 by all these
divisions, as will be more fully recounted in subsequent pages.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="15">XV</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span></h3>

<h4>A REVIEW OF THE ALLIED PLANS IN THE WEST AT THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST
BATTLE OF YPRES.</h4>


<p>At this time all our ideas in regard to the framing of plans in the
West were evolved and guided almost entirely by the progress of the
campaign in Poland and Galicia.</p>

<p>After the battle of the <span lang="fr">Marne</span>, when we were at the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span>, we were
still hopeful of effecting a great flanking movement which should lead
to more or less decisive results, or at least clear Northern France
and Belgium of the enemy's troops. It has been shown how the
development of events obliged us to modify our hopes and anticipations
until, at the close of the first battle of Ypres, we certainly felt at
our own <abbr title="general headquarter">G.H.Q.</abbr> that the Allied Forces in Great Britain, France and
Belgium, could effect nothing of importance unless and until one of
two things happened.</p>

<p>Either there must be a considerable augmentation of our forces,
including a vastly increased supply of heavy artillery, machine guns,
trench artillery and ammunition&mdash;<span class="italic">or</span>, the enemy's forces on the
Western front must be so weakened by the necessity of sending troops
to stem the Russian advance in the East, as to enable the Allies with
their available forces to assume the offensive with success.</p>

<p>Now the only resources in regard to <span class="italic">personnel</span> upon which the Allies
at that time had to depend for any considerable accession of strength
was the British "New Army," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> whose entry into the line of
battle must perforce be gradual. It could not be expected to make its
weight felt for a long time to come.</p>

<p>After the fall of Antwerp I realised that, by taking up our position
on the extreme left flank we should find ourselves very near to the
coast, and a good opportunity would be afforded of gaining the
co-operation of the Fleet. In other words, the paramount thought in my
mind was that the British and Belgian forces, co-operating with the
British Fleet, should constitute in themselves the left flank of the
Allied line in the West.</p>

<p>Whilst on the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> I had a visit from Mr. Winston Churchill, who was
then First Lord of the Admiralty. He arrived on the night of September
26th and left on the 28th. Winston Churchill had been for several
years one of my most intimate friends. I saw much of him during the
South African War, but it was not until about 1905 or 1906 that I
really got to know him well. His complex character is as difficult to
describe as it is to analyse. To those who do not understand him, the
impetuous disposition, which is one of his strongest characteristics,
is apt to throw into shadow the indomitable courage, tireless energy,
marvellous perspicuity and quick virile brain-power which are the main
features of Winston Churchill's extraordinary personality.</p>

<p>His experience and knowledge of public affairs must be unrivalled;
for, at an age when most men are undergoing the grinding drudgery
which falls to the lot of nearly all successful statesmen, lawyers,
soldiers or ecclesiastics, he was holding the highest offices in the
Government; and not even his most inveterate enemies can say that he
has failed to leave his mark for good on every department he has
supervised.</p>

<p>Possessing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> a combative nature, he engages constantly in
political strife which is marked by the sharpest controversy, and it
is, therefore, perhaps only his intimate friends who know the real
manly, generous kindliness of his disposition and his perfect loyalty.</p>

<p>The perspective of history will show the part he has played throughout
the Great War to have been consistently constructive and of direct
value to the nation.</p>

<p>His visit to my Headquarters at this time was productive of great
good. The Government were getting nervous of the military situation
and of the arrest of our forward advance. With his characteristic
energy and activity, Churchill visited and examined every part of the
battlefield, and what he saw and heard put him in a position to send
reassuring information to his colleagues.</p>

<p>I discussed with him fully my views as to the desirability of
establishing the British Forces in a theatre where they could
co-operate with the Navy and link up with the troops in Belgium. We
examined the possibility of a failure to effect a decisive turning
movement, and agreed in thinking that, in the last resort, we might
still be able, with the flank support of the Fleet, to snatch from the
enemy's possession the Belgian coast-line as far, at any rate, as
Zeebrugge.</p>

<p>When he left me on September 28th it was with a complete understanding
that he would prepare the Navy to fulfil this <span class="italic">rôle</span>, and a few
extracts from letters which I subsequently received from him will show
how well he redeemed his promise.</p>

<p class="p2">On October 26th he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... But, my dear friend, I do trust you will realise how damnable it
will be if the enemy settles down for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> the winter along lines
which comprise Calais, Dunkirk, or Ostend. There will be continual
alarms and greatly added difficulties. We must have him off the
Belgian coast even if we cannot recover Antwerp.</p>

<p>"I am getting old ships with heavy guns ready, protected by barges
with nets against submarines, so as to dispute the whole seaboard with
him. On the 31st <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr> the "Revenge," with four 13-&frac12;-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> guns, can
come into action if required, and I have a regular fleet of monitors
now organised, which, they all say, have hit the Germans hard this
week, a fleet which is getting stronger every day.</p>

<p>"If you could gain a passage off to the left, I could give you
overwhelming support from the sea, and there you will have a flank
which certainly they cannot turn...."</p>

<p class="p2">In a letter dated November 22nd, again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... If you push your left flank along the sand-dunes of the shore to
Ostend and Zeebrugge, we would give you 100 or 200 heavy guns from the
sea in absolutely devastating support. For four or five miles inshore
we could make you perfectly safe and superior. Here, at least, you
have their flank, if you care to use it; and surely, the coast strip,
held and fed well with troops, would clear the whole line out about
Dixmude and bend it right back, if it did not clear it altogether.</p>

<p>"... We could bring men in at Ostend or Zeebrugge to reinforce you in
a hard south-eastward push. There is no limit to what could be done by
the extreme left-handed push and swoop along the Dutch frontier.... In
a few hours I could have fifty 12-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> guns and seventy 6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> firing on
the enemy's right and rear. It is difficult <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span> for submarines
to attack because of the sandbanks...."</p>

<p>On December 7th the First Lord was again my guest at <abbr title="general headquarter">G.H.Q.</abbr> We
discussed the situation, and were completely in agreement as to the
advisability of my projected coastal advance and close co-operation
with the Fleet. I told him there was fear of disagreement with the
French, and that political difficulties would certainly arise. He said
he did not think that they were insuperable, and shortly after our
conversation he left for England, promising to arrange everything with
the Prime Minister and Kitchener.</p>

<p>Then came his letter, despatched on December 8th, after he had seen
his colleagues in the Cabinet:</p>

<p>"... Kitchener agrees entirely with your view. We held an immediate
conference with the Prime Minister and Sir Edward Grey, and, as the
result, the strongest possible telegram is being drafted. The
Admiralty attach the greatest importance to the operation and will aid
in every way. We are already making the necessary preparations on an
extensive scale. Later I will let you have very full and clear
details. The combination must be perfect.</p>

<p>"Kitchener proposes to let you have the 27th Division in time ... I
hope you will continue to press the new plan hard, both here at home
and on the French Generals."</p>

<p>I quote in full Sir Edward Grey's telegram, dated December 9th, to Sir
Francis Bertie at Bordeaux:</p>

<p>"The military situation points to the advisability of shortly taking
steps to prevent the Germans withdrawing their best first-line troops
from the Western theatre for employment against Russia and replacing
them by second-rate troops.</p>

<p>"As <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> some forward movement to achieve this object may be
decided on, I desire to bring to the serious attention of the French
Government the very strong opinion held by His Majesty's Government
that British troops should be so placed in the line as to advance
along the coast in immediate co-operation with our Fleet, and thus
enable us, if necessary, to land further forces at any critical
juncture during the operation.</p>

<p>"To obtain this result a slight change in the present position of Sir
John French's forces in the line would be necessary.</p>

<p>"The British troops would have to be moved to the left of the Allied
line, being replaced in their present position by the French troops
now on the left. They would thus be again taking up the position in
the line they held after moving from <span lang="fr">Soissons</span>.</p>

<p>"I would point out to the French Government that the people of this
country realise that the Belgian coastal positions are now held by
Germany as a menace to Great Britain. They would, therefore, regard
any losses entailed by an active offensive taken by our troops against
these coastal positions as fully justified. British public opinion
will even demand that the menace should be removed, for the forts on
the coast of Belgium are being prepared as a base of operations by sea
and air against Great Britain especially, and this may in time hamper
the safe transport of fresh troops from England to France.</p>

<p>"Moreover, we feel sure that our co-operation with any contemplated
French effort to drive the Germans back from their present positions
would be rendered much more effective, and lead to more decisive and
far-reaching results, if this preliminary step in the redistribution
of the troops <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span> were now taken and our troops subsequently
used in the manner indicated.</p>

<p>"His Majesty's Government consider it most urgent and important that
this step should be taken, and you should ask the French Government to
agree to it and to arrange with <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> for carrying it out."</p>

<p>The French Government received these proposals very coldly. It was
quite evident that they had no intention of leaving the British Forces
in sole charge of the Allied left, but for the moment they agreed to
regard the question as a military one and to refer it to General
<span lang="fr">Joffre</span>.</p>

<p>I had several conversations with him on the subject, but there
appeared to be no disposition on his part to acquiesce in my plans.</p>

<p>This attitude on the part of the French was evidently well known in
London, for, on December 13th, I received a letter from Winston
Churchill in which he said: "Of course, we are disappointed here with
the turn events have taken, but we shall do our best to help the
French."</p>

<p>This meant that <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> had rejected my scheme, but had substituted the
idea of another kind of attack, to be made chiefly by the French, with
fewer troops, in a different direction and with quite another
objective. I will return to this presently, for such an operation
actually took place and proved to be a very feeble substitute for what
I had intended.</p>

<p>Yielding thus to French representations, our Government began to
weaken. Churchill adhered to his views throughout, but was not
supported.</p>

<p>The terms of Sir Edward Grey's communication of December 9th were
unanswerable. Everything which subsequently happened in the course of
the war has proved it. The possession by the Germans of that strip of
Belgian coast-line <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span> has been the sharpest of all thorns with
which they have succeeded in pricking us. It has been one of the main
causes of the prolongation of the war. Their vigorous and successful
defence against all our attacks in the autumn of 1917 showed the value
which they attached to the retention of this coast-line.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener addressed a Memorandum to me in January, 1915, from
which I quote <span class="italic">in extenso</span>:</p>

<p>"The questions raised in your recent Memorandum of January 3rd,
1915"&mdash;he wrote&mdash;"and in your appreciation of the situation in the
various theatres of war, were considered by a War Council presided
over by the Prime Minister, on Thursday, January 7th, and Friday,
January 8th.</p>

<p>"The principal questions discussed were&mdash;</p>

<ul class="decimal">
<li>The proposed advance to Zeebrugge.</li>
<li>The organisation of the New Armies.</li>
<li>The possibility of employing British Forces
  in a different theatre to that in which they
  are now used.</li>
</ul>

<p>"With regard to the proposed advance to Zeebrugge, the First Lord's
telegram, <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2623, sent to you on January 2nd, explained the
difficulties imposed on the Admiralty by the development of Zeebrugge
as a base for submarines, and the War Council realised that one of
your principal motives in suggesting an offensive to effect the
capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge was to ease the naval position.</p>

<p>"On a general review, however, of the whole situation, naval and
military, the Council came to the conclusion that the advantages to be
obtained from such an advance at the present moment would not be
commensurate with the heavy losses involved, as well as the extension
that would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span> be thus caused to the lines of the Allies in
Northern Flanders.</p>

<p>"The Council was also influenced in this conclusion by the following
considerations. The first of these was that the reinforcements of 50
battalions of Territorial troops, which you considered indispensable,
could only be supplied at a considerable dislocation of the
organisation of the future reinforcements to be sent to you. It must
be borne in mind that the original organisation of the Territorial
Force included no provision for drafts. Great difficulties have
already been encountered in providing drafts for the 24 battalions
already in your command; and, although arrangements for the necessary
machinery to create a special reserve for the Territorials are in
hand, it would not at present be possible to supply 50 more battalions
with drafts without an entire reorganisation of the forces allotted to
Home Defence, and this would modify the programme for reinforcements
to join our Army in the future.</p>

<p>"The second consideration was that it is impossible at the present
time to maintain a sufficient supply of gun ammunition on the scale
which you considered necessary for offensive operations. Every effort
is being made in all parts of the world to obtain an unlimited supply
of ammunition; but, as you are well aware, the result is still far
from being sufficient to maintain the large number of guns which you
now have under your command adequately supplied with ammunition for
offensive purposes.</p>

<p>"You have pointed out that offensive operations under the new
conditions created by this war require a vast expenditure of artillery
ammunition, which may, for even 10 or 20 days, necessitate the supply
of 50 or 100 rounds per gun per day being available, and that, unless
the reserve can <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> be accumulated to meet expenditure of this
sort, it is unwise to embark on extensive offensive operations against
the enemy in trenches. It is, of course, almost impossible to
calculate with any accuracy how long offensive operations, once
undertaken, may last before the object is attained; but it is evident
that the breaking off of such operations before accomplishment, owing
to the want of artillery ammunition, and not on account of a
successful termination or a convenient pause in the operations having
been reached, might lead to a serious reverse being sustained by our
forces.</p>

<p>"The abandonment of the Zeebrugge project does not prevent you from
co-operating to the utmost extent, compatible with your present
resources, with any offensive movement contemplated by <abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>,
and your previous instructions in this sense are in no way modified.</p>

<p>"The Council further thought that there were certain indications,
which should not be neglected, of German reinforcements reaching their
Armies in the Western theatre in the near future, which may lead
German Commanders to undertake a fresh attempt to force the lines you
and the French Army hold. If this movement should develop, it could
probably be better met and defeated by holding your present lines of
prepared positions than by extending the line to the Dutch frontier
and placing the Belgian Army in probably a more exposed position than
they now occupy. You may rest assured that, as they become available,
fresh troops will be sent to you with the least possible delay to
strengthen your forces as far as is practicable. The 28th Division
have already received orders to leave for France on the 14th <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr>"</p>

<p>The telegram from the First Lord of the Admiralty, dated January 2nd,
referred to in the above memorandum, ran <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> as follows:&mdash;"The
battleship 'Formidable' was sunk this morning by a submarine in the
Channel. Information from all quarters shows that the Germans are
steadily developing an important submarine base at Zeebrugge. Unless
operations can be undertaken to clear the coast, and particularly to
capture this place, it must be recognised that the whole
transportation of troops across the Channel will be seriously and
increasingly compromised. The Admiralty are of the opinion that it
would be possible, under cover of warships, to land a large force at
Zeebrugge in conjunction with any genuine forward movement along the
shore to Ostend. They wish these views, which they have so frequently
put forward, to be placed again before the French Commander, and hope
they may receive the consideration which their urgency and importance
require."</p>

<p>It will be seen from this that Mr. Churchill was not in accord with
the views expressed in Lord Kitchener's memorandum.</p>

<p>The situation was well known to the Cabinet before the despatch of Sir
Edward Grey's telegram of December 9th. It is clear that the points
raised in the memorandum of January 9th were excuses used as a veil to
screen the disinclination of the British Government to taking a firm
stand against the attitude adopted by the French. But there was
something more.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener's objections can be easily answered. They may be
generally stated thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>(1) That the seizure from the Germans of this strip of sea coast would
not be an adequate return for the heavy losses likely to be incurred
in the operation.</p>

<p>(2) That the line then to be held would be unduly extended.</p>

<p>(3) <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> That the reinforcement of the additional troops demanded
"would only be supplied at a considerable dislocation of the
organisation of the future reinforcements to be sent you."</p>

<p>(4) That the supply of gun ammunition on the scale demanded would be
impossible.</p>

<p>(5) That embarking on such an enterprise would prejudice our power of
resisting a possible German counter-offensive in the immediate future.</p>
</div>

<p>My answer to (1) is this: Had we been in possession of the Belgian
coast-line between Nieuport and the Dutch frontier in the early part
of 1915, and had we maintained it to the end of the war, the Germans
would have been deprived in a great measure of the power they have
exercised throughout with such success, to prosecute their submarine
campaign. Any price we might have had to pay in the way of losses
would have been well worth the object attained.</p>

<p>In a lesser degree this may be said of the enemy's aircraft
enterprises. I claim that the naval history of this war clearly bears
out my contention.</p>

<p>As to (2), the extent of the line to be held would depend upon the
degree of success attained by the operations. If we had been able to
make good our advance from the left flank (between Nieuport and
Dixmude) by means of powerful naval support from the sea, the least we
should have effected would have been to clear the Germans out of the
triangle Nieuport&mdash;Dixmude&mdash;Zeebrugge.</p>

<p>If the operation had then to be suspended, we should have had to hold
the line Dixmude&mdash;Zeebrugge instead of Dixmude&mdash;Nieuport. In actual
distance the former space is about double the latter. But our position
at Zeebrugge would have afforded a large measure of naval support,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> and the country to the south-west of that place lends itself
to inundations. This would have enabled us to occupy the north-eastern
portion of the line in much less strength. Further, it was just in
anticipation of such a necessity that the extra troops were asked for.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, however, as such a situation would have forced upon the
enemy the necessity of holding a dangerous and exposed salient which
could be reached on the north side by our guns from the Fleet, it is
more than possible that he would have effected such a retirement as
would have considerably shortened our line.</p>

<p>(3) This contention is disputed; but even if it were true, it is no
sound military argument against embarking on an operation which
promised such valuable results.</p>

<p>(4) There is a complete answer to this objection. Some two or three
months later, large trainloads of ammunition&mdash;heavy, medium, and
light&mdash;passed by the rear of the Army in France <span class="italic">en route</span> to
Marseilles for shipment to the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>(5) The best possible means of warding off an attack is to take a
strong and powerful initiative.</p>

<p>I cannot characterise these reasons for rejecting my plans as other
than illogical, and I feel sure they must really have appeared so to
their authors.</p>

<p>Perhaps the true explanation which underlay all this is to be found in
the following Memorandum of the War Council of January 9th, 1915. It
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">the possibility of employing british forces in a different theatre
than that in which they are now used.</span></p>

<p>"The Council considered carefully your remarks on this subject in
reply to Lord Kitchener's letter, and came to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span> the conclusion
that, certainly for the present, the main theatre of operations for
British forces should be alongside the French Army, and that this
should continue as long as France was liable to successful invasion
and required armed support. It was also realised that, should the
offensive operations subsequently drive the Germans out of France and
back to Germany, British troops should assist in such operations. It
was thought that, after another failure by Germany to force the lines
of defence held by the French Army and yours, the military situation
in France and Flanders might conceivably develop into one of
stalemate, in which it would be impossible for German forces to break
through into France, while at the same time the German defences would
be impassable for offensive movements of the Allies without great loss
of life and the expenditure of more ammunition than could be provided.
In these circumstances, it was considered desirable to find some other
theatre where such obstructions to advance would be less pronounced,
and from where operations against the enemy might lead to more
decisive results.</p>

<p>"For these reasons, the War Council decided that certain of the
possible projects for pressing the war in other theatres should be
carefully studied during the next few weeks, so that, as soon as the
new forces are fit for action, plans may be ready to meet any
eventuality that may be then deemed expedient, either from a political
point of view, or to enable our forces to act with the best advantage
in concert with the troops of other nations throwing in their lot with
the Allies."</p>

<p>In fact, the idea became fixed in the minds of the War Council that a
condition of stalemate was bound to occur on the Western front, and
therefore other theatres which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> might afford greater
opportunities of prosecuting a successful offensive must be sought.</p>

<p>I was asked for my views as to this, and I gave them in full. Space
does not allow me to quote my memorandum on the subject <span class="italic">in extenso</span>,
but my ideas will be gleaned from the concluding paragraphs, which run
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Assuming however, that all the foregoing arguments are brushed aside,
it remains to be seen where any effective action could be taken. The
countries to be considered are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">a</span>) <span class="italic">Russia.</span>&mdash;Impossible, as there is no means of sending an Army
there, the Baltic being closed. Archangel shut in winter and
unsuitable at other seasons, and Vladivostok much too far away.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">b</span>) <span class="italic">Denmark</span> and (<span class="italic">c</span>) <span class="italic">Holland</span>.&mdash;One or other of these countries
would have to declare war on Germany unless her neutrality were
violated, and in both cases the overseas communication would be so
vulnerable to mine or torpedo attack as to be in the highest degree
insecure.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">d</span>) <span class="italic">North German Coast.</span>&mdash;Communications would be equally
vulnerable.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">e</span>) <span class="italic">Italy.</span>&mdash;Assumes that Italy is a friendly belligerent, in
which case she would probably not require the assistance of British
troops, as her own action should be sufficient to finish Austria. It
is unlikely that Italy would be induced to join in simply by the offer
of troops which her military intelligence must know would be better
employed elsewhere.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">f</span>) <span class="italic">Istria and Dalmatia.</span>&mdash;A very dangerous line of communication,
and one which would be impossible in the face of a hostile Italy. The
islands on the Dalmatian seaboard are specially favourable for the
action of defending submarines and torpedo craft, while mines might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span> render any approach to the coast out of the question. With an
actively friendly Italy an advance through her territory would be more
practicable, but, as stated in preceding paragraph, unnecessary.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">g</span>) Through Greece to Servia, presumably <span class="italic">viâ</span>, Salonika, presumes
Greece to be a friendly belligerent. Probably the least objectionable
of any possible proposal, but necessitating the strict neutrality of
Bulgaria, as otherwise the land communications would be very open to
attack. A hostile Italy would also jeopardise the whole force.</p>

<p>"(<span class="italic">h</span>) <span class="italic">Gallipoli</span>, <span class="italic">Asia Minor</span>, <span class="italic">Syria</span>.&mdash;Any attack on Turkey would
be devoid of decisive result. In the most favourable circumstances it
could only cause the relaxation of the pressure against Russia in the
Caucasus and enable her to transfer two or three Corps to the West&mdash;a
result quite incommensurate with the effort involved. To attack Turkey
would be to play the German game and to bring about the end which
Germany had in mind when she induced Turkey to join in the war,
namely, to draw off troops from the decisive spot, which is Germany
itself.</p>

<p>"To sum up, my opinions are&mdash;</p>

<p>"(1) That the impossibility of breaking through the German line in
Flanders has not been proved, and that that operation is feasible
provided a sufficiency of high-explosive shells and of guns is
provided.</p>

<p>"(2) That, even if it were proved impossible to break the German line,
so large a margin of safety is needed that troops could not be
withdrawn from this theatre. It is to be remembered that the Allies
are in a much better position to await the outcome of events. Time is
against Germany; she will not sit for ever behind her entrenchments,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>(p. 317)</span> the Allies must be prepared with an adequate force to
strike her whenever she may attempt to break out or withdraw.</p>

<p>"(3) That there are no theatres, other than those in which operations
are now in progress, in which decisive results could be attained.</p>

<p>"I have not gone into details in considering the question of the
employment of forces in other theatres, as such operations were
considered by the <abbr title="military operations">M.O.</abbr> Directorate of the War Office when I was
<abbr title="Chief of the Imperial General Staff">C.I.G.S.</abbr>, and I have no doubt that a full record of the conclusions
which were reached are filed there."</p>

<p>General <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s final opinion is expressed in a memorandum, dated
January 19th, 1915, of which the following is a summary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. I wish to call your particular attention to the following
points:&mdash;</p>

<p>"2. The French General Staff consider a German offensive
possible&mdash;even probable&mdash;in the near future. The Germans are certainly
making new formations; the 38th Corps has been identified in Bavaria.</p>

<p>"3. Our front must therefore be made absolutely secure. If broken, for
example, about <span lang="fr">Roye</span> and <span lang="fr">Montdidier</span>, the consequences for the Allies
would be of the most serious description.</p>

<p>"4. In addition to (3) we must place ourselves in the position of
being able to assume the offensive.</p>

<p>"5. Because of (3) and (4), reserves are absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"6. For these reasons, I am anxious for a rapid release of the Corps
north of the British line.</p>

<p>"7. We must never lose sight of the decisive result, and all secondary
operations must give way.</p>

<p>"8. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span> Operations towards Ostend&mdash;Zeebrugge, though important,
are, for the moment, secondary, and in my opinion should follow rather
than precede the principal action, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the Collection of Reserves.</p>

<p>"To resume:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left10">
<p>(<span class="italic">a</span>) To beat the enemy it is necessary to have Reserves.</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">b</span>) These Reserves can only come from the north, as British
reinforcements set them free.</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">c</span>) The German menace, not a vain thing, makes it necessary to
collect these Reserves in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">d</span>) The main object, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the defeat of the enemy, makes it
necessary to delay the offensive towards Ostend&mdash;Zeebrugge."</p>
</div>

<p>I always disagreed with these views, and remain convinced that my
plans should have been accepted and tried. I will only add, as a
further argument against embarking upon operations in other theatres
of war, that our military forces at that time, and for at least
fifteen months afterwards, were not sufficient to enable us to carry
on great operations in more than one theatre with the necessary power
and energy required for success. They could only have resulted in what
actually happened in 1915, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the series of feeble and on the whole
unsuccessful attempts to break through the German line in France, and
an absolute failure, compelling ultimate withdrawal of our troops, in
the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>I have dealt at perhaps wearisome length with the strategic
alternatives and the problems which presented themselves for solution
after the close of the First Battle of Ypres. It has been necessary to
do so in order that my <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>(p. 319)</span> countrymen may understand the
situation as it actually existed at the time, and that they may
appreciate what seemed to me conclusive reasons why greater progress
was not made in 1915.</p>

<p>Divided counsels lead to half measures and indecisive action. Such
counsels have always had, and always will have, the most deterrent and
disadvantageous effect on any vigorous prosecution of a war, great or
small.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="16">XVI</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span></h3>

<h4>THE OPERATIONS OF DECEMBER 14TH-19TH, 1914</h4>


<p>For the plan sketched out in the last chapter, a certain amount of
naval co-operation was secured. The Admiralty were always strongly in
favour of my original proposal, and did not at all like the
half-hearted operation which <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> was substituting for it. They
urged, with great force and reason, that the risks run by the ships in
co-operation on the Belgian coast were increasingly great owing to the
powerful fortifications erected by the Germans, and the presence of
enemy submarines at Zeebrugge. Whilst, therefore, those risks might
well be run in support of a real, strenuous, and powerful endeavour to
wrench the coast-line from the enemy's grasp, the Admiralty felt that
the Navy could not afford to sacrifice strength in hanging about day
after day exposed to such risks, in the sole hope of rendering some
slight help to an attack which had no great or decisive object in
view. In proof of this, I quote the following telegrams which were
received from the Admiralty. On December 20th, 1914, they wired as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are receiving almost daily requests from the French for naval
support on the Belgian coast. We regret we are unable to comply. The
small vessels by themselves cannot face the new shore batteries, and
it is not justifiable to expose battleships to submarine perils unless
to support a land attack of primary importance.</p>

<p>"If <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> such an attack is delivered, all the support in my
Memorandum forwarded to you through Secretary of State for War will,
of course, be afforded. I would be glad if you would explain this to
<abbr title="general">Gen.</abbr> Foch, as it is painful to the officers concerned to make repeated
refusals."</p>

<p>A previous wire had arrived on the 18th, the last few lines of which
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not justifiable to expose 'Majestic' to submarine risks unless
to support a real movement, in which case every risk will be run and
ample support provided."</p>

<p>And before this, on the 12th, the following was received:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you please put us in communication with the French General who
will conduct the operation.... Meanwhile, all our preparations as
outlined are proceeding, ... but the serious risks to our ships, both
from batteries and submarines, ought not to be incurred except in an
operation of the first importance."</p>

<p>Admiral Hood, who afterwards fell so gloriously in the hour of victory
at the Battle of Jutland, was then in command at Dover. He was
responsible for the naval co-operation arranged for, and came to my
Headquarters on the 13th to discuss plans. It was arranged that at
daybreak on the 15th the advance from Nieuport was to be supported by
two battleships, three monitors and six destroyers.</p>

<p>I urged the Quartermaster-General to do his utmost to provide more
machine guns. At that time we had considerably less than one per
company, and it was an arm in which the Germans were particularly well
found. They must at that time have had at least six or seven to our
one.</p>

<p>In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span> the operations now under discussion, this disability was
felt very severely. In discussing the progress of the fight with
General <span lang="fr">d'Urbal</span> on the 15th at Poperinghe, he told me that the slight
and disappointing advance made by the French was due to their being
everywhere held up by machine-gun fire. He said the enemy had received
large machine-gun reinforcements, and he was then sending down special
guns in armoured motors to endeavour to crush them.</p>

<p>From all parts of the line the same complaint came of the
preponderance of the enemy's machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>The operations opened on the morning of the 14th by a combined attack
on the line Hollebeke&mdash;Wytschaete ridge. It began when it was hardly
daylight, at 7 a.m., by heavy artillery bombardment. At 7.45, the
French right (five regiments of the 16th Corps) moved forward and
captured the enemy's advance trenches on our left flank.</p>

<p>The 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Royal Scots and 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Gordons (of Bowes' 8th
Brigade, 3rd Division) then advanced on <span lang="fr">Petit Bois</span> and Mendleston
Farm. The Royal Scots seized and held the wood, which in the evening
they entrenched on the eastern side. They captured about sixty
prisoners, including some officers.</p>

<p>The Gordons at dusk had captured the enemy's trenches surrounding
Mendleston Farm, but were again driven out of them by a powerful
machine-gun counter-attack. They had to fall back on their own
trenches.</p>

<p>The French 32nd Corps attacked to the north of the 16th on the line
Klein Zillebeke&mdash;Zillebeke, and advanced some 200 to 300 yards. They
repulsed a German counter-attack from Zandvoorde and captured the
trenches in front of the château of Hollebeke.</p>

<p>As <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> the French had not established themselves in the position
agreed upon, the 3rd Division was unable to advance further, whilst
the 5th Division (right of 2nd Corps) and all the 3rd Corps were
confined the whole day to demonstration and holding the enemy.</p>

<p>I visited the <span class="italic" lang="fr">Poste de Commandement</span> of the 3rd Division Commander
(Haldane) on the Scherpenberg&mdash;a hill near <span lang="fr">Bailleul</span>, surmounted by a
windmill&mdash;in the afternoon, and witnessed the fighting for some time.
It struck me that the enemy artillery fire was much weaker than ours.</p>

<p>The operations were continued on the 15th, and I again spent some time
on the Scherpenberg watching the progress of the fight, so far as the
weather permitted any view; we were again prevented from advancing
owing to the delay of the French on our left. Our joint plan was that
successive points had to be taken from north to south. It is obvious
that the movement had to commence on the French left, but from the
first our Allies failed to execute their task and we had to wait for
them.</p>

<p>The weather was terrible and the ground simply quagmire, whilst the
rain, cold, and the awful mud of the holding soil paralysed any
energetic attempt to drive the enemy back. A desultory fire was kept
up at all points along the line; but no great activity appeared to be
possible. The <span class="italic">rôle</span> of the 2nd Corps was quite plain and clear: it
had to wait for the 16th French Corps to reach its allotted points.</p>

<p>Later in the day I went round to the 3rd Corps Headquarters and there
met the Corps Commander (Pulteney), Du Cane, his Chief of Staff, and
Allenby, Commanding the Cavalry.</p>

<p>I discussed the general course of the operations with them. I had in
my mind the possibility of giving some impetus <span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>(p. 324)</span> to the
general advance by making an attack with troops of the 3rd Corps
across the River <span lang="fr">Douve</span>, and thus directly supporting an advance by
Smith-Dorrien's right, perhaps supported by the cavalry. The mud and
water in the valley of that river, however, presented insuperable
difficulties.</p>

<p>During the night of the 15th-16th, troops of the 5th Division captured
some trenches to the south of <span lang="fr">Messines</span>.</p>

<p>I was much perturbed at the slow progress we were making, as no better
reports came from anywhere along the whole of the Allied line.</p>

<p>On the 16th I again visited the Scherpenberg, where I was met by
Smith-Dorrien and Haldane. Smith-Dorrien assured me that the
understanding between himself and the Commander of the 16th French
Corps on his left (General Grosetti) to provide for mutual support and
co-operation had been complete.</p>

<p>As our great aim was now to reduce the enemy's machine-gun fire, I
directed Smith-Dorrien to send his pack artillery, which had recently
been given him, close down behind the trenches and dig them well in.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">De Maud'huy</span>'s attack north of <span lang="fr">Arras</span> was begun on the 16th by a heavy
artillery bombardment. The infantry attack followed on the 17th, but
the results were disappointing, although a little ground was gained
near Notre Dame de Lorette. Some slight progress was made by the
French 21st Corps.</p>

<p>I tried to see Foch, but he was away from his Headquarters with <span lang="fr">de
Maud'huy</span>. I sent Henry Wilson after him to explain my views, namely,
that our present plan must be modified, owing largely to the fact that
we had considerably under-estimated the enemy's strength, particularly
in the matter of machine guns. Foch sent Wilson back <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span> to tell
me that he agreed in thinking that the present operations had not
proved a success. He proposed to break them off as soon as we could
reconsider our arrangements. He begged me, however, to continue
demonstrating all along my front as much as possible, with a view to
supporting the attack upon which <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span> was now embarked.</p>

<p>It was at this time that one of the many instances occurred of the
evils which attend divided command. There was undoubtedly a great
opportunity on and about December 18th for a powerful attack opposite
Wytschaete. I proposed to mass the 16th French and 2nd British Corps
at this point, when I discovered that the 16th Corps was practically
melting away on my left flank. Two brigades had been despatched to the
north, and other units had been sent away to support <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span>'s
attack on <span lang="fr">Arras</span>. I was in complete ignorance of these moves until they
were accomplished facts. I therefore had to give up all idea of a
joint attack on any large scale for the present, and issued orders to
Corps Commanders enjoining them to demonstrate on their immediate
front, to keep the enemy occupied and seize any opportunity which
might offer to capture hostile trenches.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomson (liaison officer with General <span lang="fr">de Castelnau</span>) told me
that the 2nd French Army had made some progress, the first line of the
enemy trenches near Albert had been taken and the ground made good.
Progress was also made near <span lang="fr">Roye</span>.</p>

<p>Captain Spiers (11th Hussars), who was now my liaison officer with
General <span lang="fr">de Maud'huy</span>, came to me. He told me that a German
counter-attack on <span lang="fr">Notre Dame de Lorrette</span> had regained all ground lost
by the enemy on the day before, but that the attack on <span lang="fr">Givenchy-les-La
Bassée</span> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span> had succeeded only to the extent of capturing a
trench west of the village, and that progress was being slowly made to
the north. The ground won at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurent was retained in spite of
repeated German counter-attacks. Some trenches north of Notre Dame de
Consolation (east of <span lang="fr">Vermelles</span>) were also taken and held.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to mention Spiers' name before. He has since
deservedly risen to much higher rank. In my mind I always used to
class him with Captain Colquhoun Grant of Peninsular fame&mdash;one of
Wellington's most trusted scouting officers.</p>

<p>I have a most vivid and grateful recollection of the invaluable
services performed by this intrepid young officer. He is possessed of
an extremely acute perception, and is able to express himself and
deliver his reports in the clearest and most concise terms. He was
always exact and accurate, and never failed to bring me back the
information I most particularly wanted. I seldom knew him at fault. He
was a perfect master of the French language and was popular with the
staffs, and made welcome by the various generals to whom he was
attached. His unfailing tact, judgment and resource were very marked.
His reckless, daring courage often made me anxious for his safety,
and, indeed, he was severely wounded on at least five separate
occasions.</p>

<p>I remember well his coming back to report to me late one evening. He
spoke with his usual confidence and decision, and the information
which he gave me proved to be very important and accurate, but I
noticed that his voice was weak and he looked very tired and worn in
the face. I sent him away to his quarters as quickly as possible,
thinking he wanted rest. All this time he had a bullet in his side,
and in that condition he had travelled <span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span> back several miles to
make his report. He fainted after leaving my room, and lay in
considerable danger for several days.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative. The 3rd, 4th, and Indian Corps were all
energetic in carrying out my latest orders, and demonstrated with
considerable activity. On the 19th the 8th Division captured some
trenches at <span lang="fr">Neuve Chapelle</span>, and the 7th Division at <span lang="fr">Rouges Bancs</span>, but
of the latter, the 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards, in the 20th Brigade, were
driven back by a counter-attack; as also were the Devons.</p>

<p>Attacks were made very early in the morning by the Garhwal, Sirhind,
and Ferozepore Brigades. Each was successful, and parts of the enemy's
trenches were captured.</p>

<p>The Garhwal Brigade captured two machine guns and some prisoners, but
had to return to their own trenches in the evening.</p>

<p>The 11th Brigade of the 4th Division, under Hunter Weston (1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Somerset <abbr title="Light-Infantry">L.I.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="east">E.</abbr> Lancs <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Hampshire <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>,
1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Rifle Brigade), made a concerted attack on the morning of
the 19th on the edge of Ploegsteert Wood. Some houses were captured,
but the mud and the wet made progress difficult. However, they
maintained their position well.</p>

<p>The success of the Indian Corps was destined to be of but short
duration. During the night of the 20th the enemy regained all the
trenches they had taken except some sap-heads near <span lang="fr">Givenchy</span>. The
Germans attacked at daybreak all along the line between
<span lang="fr">Givenchy-les-La Bassée</span> and <span lang="fr">la Quinque Rue</span>. The Sirhind Brigade were
driven back on <span lang="fr">Festubert</span>, and <span lang="fr">Givenchy</span> was lost, but retaken in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>On the front of the Meerut Division only the Garhwal Brigade <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span>
on the left held its ground, and in the evening the situation was
serious, the Germans occupying nearly all our line between <span lang="fr">Givenchy</span>
and <span lang="fr">Richebourg</span>, whilst the Corps reserves were all engaged. In the
evening the three brigades of the Indian Cavalry Corps were thrown
into the fight.</p>

<p>At night Sir James Willcocks reported his troops as much exhausted,
and urged their immediate relief; the 1st Corps was therefore ordered
to send two brigades (1st and 3rd) up to the line occupied by the
Indian Corps.</p>

<p>At 2.35 p.m. these two brigades advanced and partially restored the
situation on the front <span lang="fr">Givenchy&mdash;Festubert</span>, driving the enemy out of
<span lang="fr">Givenchy</span>. The 2nd Brigade (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Sussex <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="north">N.</abbr>
Lancs, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Northants <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Kings Royal Rifle">K.R.R.</abbr>) had now also been
ordered up, and advanced in support of the Lahore Division.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 21st the 1st Corps were ordered to take over the
Indian Corps' line. In the early hours of the 22nd the 1st Brigade
(1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Coldstream Guards, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Black
Watch, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Cameron Highlanders) made <span lang="fr">Givenchy</span> secure. The 3rd
Brigade (2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal">R.</abbr> Munster Fusiliers, 1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> Wales Borderers,
1st <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Gloucester <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>, 2nd <abbr title="battalion">Batt.</abbr> Welsh <abbr title="regiment">Regt.</abbr>) was unable to
re-establish the original line on the left of the 1st Brigade, but
occupied a line thrown slightly back.</p>

<p>The 2nd Brigade endeavoured to gain the old line at <span lang="fr">la Quinque Rue</span>,
but was unable to do so, and secured a position with its right in
touch with the Meerut Brigade and in front of <span lang="fr">Festubert</span>.</p>

<p>At 1 p.m. on the 22nd Sir Douglas Haig (commanding the 1st Corps)
assumed command in this area.</p>

<p>On <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> the 23rd the 27th Division, which had been despatched from
England, completed its detrainment and concentrated in the area about
<span lang="fr">Arques</span> (near <span lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer</span>).</p>

<p>On the 17th I received a letter from Kitchener from which I gleaned
that the Cabinet were much perturbed by rumours of a contemplated
invasion by the enemy, which apparently emanated from the Admiralty.
The authorities at home were far from happy about the whole situation
on the Western front, and it was greatly feared that our line might
still be broken through by a determined German offensive.</p>

<p>I received orders to go home and consult with the Cabinet, and arrived
at Folkestone about 11 a.m. on Sunday the 20th. Lord Kitchener met me
there with his motor and we drove together to Walmer Castle, where the
Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) was then staying. I had not seen
Kitchener since our memorable meeting at Paris, early in September,
but he met me in the most friendly manner, and said many kind things
about our work in France, of which he clearly appreciated the
difficulties. We discussed the situation fully <span class="italic">en route</span>, and I
remember his putting many questions to me about all the principal
members of the Headquarters Staff. Whilst assuring him of my entire
satisfaction with each and all of them, I reminded him that, if any
fault was to be found, I and no one else was responsible.</p>

<p>In this and many subsequent conversations of a similar kind, I always
maintained that a Commander-in-Chief can only be held in contempt who
allows any member of his staff, or, indeed, any officer under his
orders, to bear blame which must always most properly belong to <span class="italic">him</span>
and to <span class="italic">him alone</span>. A chief in supreme command has always the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> absolute power of replacing any officer who fails in his
duty. To <span class="italic">him</span> comes the principal credit and reward when things go
well, and to <span class="italic">him</span> and him alone must the blame be apportioned when
they do not. Until any officer under him is found by <span class="italic">him</span> to be unfit
for his position, it is contrary to all efficient discipline to allow
such officer to be censured or removed by any outside authority.</p>

<p>This principle is one of the most sacred traditions of the British
Army. It is the foundation upon which there has been slowly and
carefully built up that mutual confidence which exists between
officers and men, which is the real secret of their wonderful fighting
power. I recalled to Kitchener's memory our service together in South
Africa, and reminded him how truly and faithfully he had always kept
up this tradition in his own exercise of command.</p>

<p>After four months of the most ruthless war the world has ever seen, it
was a curious sensation to find myself once again on English soil and
in the midst of peaceful surroundings. It was one of those mild, balmy
days which we very seldom get in the month of December, and the usual
English Sunday atmosphere of rest and repose was over every object,
animate and inanimate.</p>

<p>I could not help feeling deeply the extraordinary contrast which the
scene presented to that which I had left behind me a few hours before.
Except that one noticed a few men in khaki, there was nothing to
indicate the terrific war which was raging all the time just across
the Channel.</p>

<p>The people of this country have never truly realised the wonderful
immunity from the horrors of war which they alone of all the
belligerent countries have enjoyed. I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> wonder if it has
really struck any large number of them that, after more than four
years of desperate strife, we are the only people in Europe who can
proudly claim that no enemy has ever occupied one square inch of all
our vast Empire throughout the world, except for a short time in East
Africa. The soil of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria,
France, Russia, Italy, Serbia, and Roumania has been repeatedly
violated. It is truly a great record when we come to think that the
sun never sets on the British flag.</p>

<p>On arriving at Walmer Castle I was very kindly and cordially welcomed
by the Prime Minister. Entering the historic old stronghold, where the
great Iron Duke breathed his last, I remember being at first seized
with a pang of regret; for I thought his spirit would have rested in
greater peace, if, under that famous roof, I could have told the first
Minister of the King that we had once again planted the British flag
in the face of the enemy on the field of Waterloo. It was a dream I
had indulged in from the first, but, alas! like many others, it was
destined never to be realised.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="17">XVII</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>(p. 332)</span></h3>

<h4>THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR 1914</h4>

<p>I had a long discussion with the Prime Minister at Walmer. Mr. Asquith
possesses the rare quality of being able to discuss the most difficult
and threatening situation with the utmost calmness and deliberation.
He is a very attentive listener, and as he quickly appreciates and
understands all that is told him, it did not take him long to become
fully acquainted with the entire situation.</p>

<p>As I have said before, all the Cabinet were at this moment very
anxious as to the general outlook, but neither by word nor gesture did
the Prime Minister display the least want of hope and confidence.</p>

<p>During my sojourn in France I had received several most kind and
encouraging letters from Mr. Asquith, in which he expressed his warm
appreciation of all that we had done, and said how truly he realised
the very trying circumstances which surrounded us. He personally
reiterated these kindly sentiments; but it was evident that the
Government had just begun to entertain doubts and fears which had
induced them to call me into council. It was the faith inspired by
this constant kindly sympathy, and his power as Prime Minister, which
helped me to believe that the shortage in guns and ammunition which
threatened ultimate destruction would be overcome. The glorious troops
under my command had gone valiantly to their death when a few more
guns and a few more shells would have many times saved their
sacrifice. And still no sufficient supplies came.</p>

<p>The question of munitions and the fear of invasion formed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span>
the basis of our long conversation at Walmer. After lunch, I left with
Kitchener and travelled by motor to London. With deep sorrow I recall
the fact that this was the last of all the many days of happy personal
intercourse which I spent with my old South African chief. As a
soldier and a commander in the field I had always loved and venerated
him; in his capacity as a politician and Minister my sentiments and
feelings towards him were never the same.</p>

<p>I am willing to admit that our differences&mdash;which were great and
far-reaching&mdash;may have been to some extent my own fault; but, be that
as it may, our subsequent relations, down to the time of his tragic
death, were always clouded by a certain mistrust of one another.</p>

<p>It rejoices my heart, and alleviates the pain and regret which I feel,
to look back upon this one day spent almost entirely <span class="italic">tête-à-tête</span>
with him. On our way to London we had to pass by his country place at
Broome, and he insisted on stopping for an hour to show me round it.
To describe what I saw would only be a repetition of what is already
very well known. As he stood in the midst of its beautiful scenery and
surroundings, the true spirit of the great soldier shone out as
distinctly and clearly as it ever did in the many and varied
experiences we went through together in the South African War.</p>

<p>The eloquent and touching tribute paid to this great soldier's memory
by Lord Derby in the House of Lords in June, 1916, brought out with
telling force and happy expression Kitchener's deep affection for his
"beloved Broome."<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="smaller">[7]</span></a></p>

<p>Indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> beneath that seemingly hard and stern exterior there
existed a mighty well of sensitive feeling and even of romance, which
it appeared to be the one endeavour of his life to conceal from the
observation even of his most intimate friends.</p>

<p>All the next day, and far into the following, my whole time was
employed in discussing the situation with the War Cabinet.</p>

<p>The principal ground for all their fears proved subsequently, in the
course of the year 1916, to be only too well founded as regards the
Eastern front. But the reports of large movements of German troops to
the West, which really induced Mr. Asquith to send for me, were not
true. Constant reports, however, continued to reach the Government
from secret and reliable sources, that the Russians were even then
running very short of ammunition, and that their condition, as regards
the supply of war material generally, would certainly oblige them to
evacuate the enemy territory they had already won, and even
necessitate a retirement behind the Vistula, if not the Bug, with the
loss of Warsaw and other important fortresses. The home authorities
were undoubtedly influenced in forming this opinion by reports which,
however, did not emanate from any part of the Western theatre of war,
and I believe their judgment was generally hampered and warped by
paying too much regard to unauthorised <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> statements. The
divergence of views which existed on various dates during the month of
December is curiously illustrated by the following quotations from
letters and telegrams.</p>

<p>On the 2nd, Kitchener wired to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is reported new corps are arriving in Russia and that some of the
old corps lately between <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> and the sea have disappeared from
that front. Can you ascertain what truth there is in this? It is
thought possible the Germans may be replacing active corps by immature
formations along northern portion of Allied lines so as to use their
best troops in the Eastern theatre, where they are apparently
developing great strength."</p>

<p>On the 18th he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Russian news is very serious. I fear we cannot rely on them for
much more for some time."</p>

<p>On the 26th I received the following telegram from him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think before you see <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> it may be useful for you to know I am
inclined to think Russians have been bluffing to a certain extent. I
cannot get answers to my questions from Petrograd which would clear up
the situation. For instance, amount of reserve ammunition in hand,
which, according to Military <span lang="fr">Attaché</span> here, who is kept entirely in the
dark by his Government, ought to be very considerable.</p>

<p>"A reason for a certain amount of bluff on their part might be that
they are now negotiating to obtain from us a loan of forty millions.
Anyway, their action in the field does not look as if they were as
badly off as they make out."</p>

<p>All kinds of reports continued to arrive, insisting that masses of
German troops were passing through Luxemburg <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> and Belgium <span class="italic">en
route</span> to the Western front; but these turned out subsequently to be
either greatly exaggerated or to have no foundation whatever in fact.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that I received directions from the Prime
Minister to seek out <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> as soon after my return as possible, put
these views and fears of the War Cabinet before him, and to report to
them what he was prepared to do in order to meet the supposed threat.</p>

<p>Before leaving I was received in audience by His Majesty the King.</p>

<p>On my journey back to the front, I pondered long and anxiously over
all that had passed in London. I had plainly told the War Cabinet that
I did not share these alarmist views, which I considered were not
founded on any definite or reliable information, and I had warned them
that these views disagreed altogether with our appreciation of the
situation at the front. I by no means liked my mission to <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>; but
the orders received were imperative.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th, I had a long conference with Murray and
Macdonogh, and we once more thoroughly examined the situation in all
its bearings.</p>

<p>The daily official reports tended to show that the Russians were still
holding their own well, and that there was no immediate fear of a
retirement behind the Vistula. Even if pessimistic views held in
London were warranted by the actual facts, it did not appear that
there was any reasonable probability of the Germans ever being able to
mass a sufficient force in the Western theatre to enable them to break
through our line.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Prime Minister's decision, I arranged a meeting
with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> at Chantilly for the 27th.</p>

<p>I found things were going on better in the north on the Yser. The
Belgians had been able to resume active hostilities, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> and the
5th Belgian Division had made good the ground on the right bank of the
river about Dixmude.</p>

<p>I began the last of the six Christmas days I have during my life
passed in the field by visiting Foch. I told him of my mission to
<span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, and discussed with him the situation in the East. He said he
felt sure that the Russians were exaggerating their deficiencies in
ammunition, rifles, etc., in their representations both to the British
and French Governments. He thought that they were afraid that the
troops in the West were not displaying sufficient energy, and their
idea was to stimulate this. Moreover, he said he was confirmed in this
view by what the Russians were then doing in Poland and Galicia, which
was also confirmed from German sources. He could not believe that, if
they were, as they said, so short of ammunition, they could continue
these aggressive tactics. He went on to speak of the work of the
French at <span lang="fr">Arras</span>, and said they had been much hampered by weather
conditions, but that they were making some slight progress everywhere.
He thought we might shortly find some opportunity for action in the
neighbourhood of <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span>.</p>

<p>On my return to Headquarters I met Haig and Smith-Dorrien, who had
come to lunch, and I discussed with them my wish to form "Armies"
immediately. I wished Haig to command the 1st, 4th, and Indian Corps
as the 1st Army, and Smith-Dorrien the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Corps as the
2nd Army. The cavalry was to remain at my immediate disposal. Orders
to this effect came out on Christmas night.</p>

<p>Although I have never heard it actually confirmed, I believe a
suggestion was made by the Pope to all the belligerent Powers that an
armistice should be arranged for Christmas Day. It was further
reported that the Central Powers had signified their assent, but that
the Allied <span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> Governments refused to entertain the proposal.
The suggestion was certainly never referred either to <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> or to me.</p>

<p>Whether this statement was true or not, it is certain that, soon after
daylight on Christmas morning, the Germans took a very bold initiative
at several points along our front, in trying to establish some form of
fraternisation. It began by individual unarmed men running from the
German trenches across to ours, holding Christmas trees above their
heads. These overtures were in some places favourably received and
fraternisation of a limited kind took place during the day. It
appeared that a little feasting went on, and junior officers,
non-commissioned officers and men on either side conversed together in
"No Man's Land."</p>

<p>When this was reported to me I issued immediate orders to prevent any
recurrence of such conduct, and called the local commanders to strict
account, which resulted in a good deal of trouble.</p>

<p>I have since often thought deeply over the principle involved in the
manifestation of such sentiments between hostile armies in the field.
I am not sure that, had the question of the agreement upon an
armistice for the day been submitted to me, I should have dissented
from it. I have always attached the utmost importance to the
maintenance of that chivalry in war which has almost invariably
characterised every campaign of modern times in which this country has
been engaged. The Germans glaringly and wantonly set all such
sentiments at defiance by their ruthless conduct of the present war;
even from its very commencement.</p>

<p>Judging from my own experience, we never had a more chivalrous or
generous foe than the Boers of South Africa, and I can recall numerous
proofs of it.</p>

<p>For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span> instance, I was in charge of the operations against
General Beyers in the Western Transvaal during the latter part of
December 1900. On the afternoon of Christmas Eve a flag of truce&mdash;that
symbol of civilisation and chivalry in war which has been practically
unknown during this war with Germany&mdash;appeared at our outposts, and a
young Dutch officer was brought to my Headquarters carrying a request
from Beyers regarding the burial of his dead.</p>

<p>Some important movements were then in progress, and I told him we must
of necessity detain him there till the next day, but I hoped we would
be able to make him as comfortable as possible. When he started back
to his General on Christmas morning, I gave him a small box of cigars
and a bottle of whiskey, asking him to present them to Beyers as a
Christmas offering from me.</p>

<p>I had forgotten the incident when, a few days later, two cavalry
soldiers who had been taken prisoners by the enemy marched back into
camp with horses, arms and equipment complete. They brought me a note
from Beyers, thanking me for my gift on Christmas Day and telling me
that, although he had no whiskey or cigars to offer in return, he
hoped I would regard his liberation of these men in the light of a
Christmas gift.</p>

<p>When I told this story at the end of the war to my old friend and
redoubtable opponent, General Christian Smuts, he expressed himself as
very displeased with Beyer's improper use of what was not his own but
his country's property. I pointed out to Smuts that it was the spirit
which Beyers displayed which mattered&mdash;that spirit which was never
more conspicuously displayed throughout the war than in the conduct of
this same great soldier and statesman, General Smuts himself.</p>

<p>In the swift and kaleidoscopic changes which occur in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> world
politics, the friend of to-day may be the enemy of to-morrow. Soldiers
should have no politics, but should cultivate a freemasonry of their
own and, emulating the knights of old, should honour a brave enemy
only second to a comrade, and like them rejoice to split a friendly
lance to-day and ride boot to boot in the charge to-morrow.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to know that some such kindly and chivalrous spirit
has at least made itself felt at times between the opposing flying
services in the present war, for I have heard authentic stories which
go to show that this has been the case.</p>

<p>On the 26th I met Willcocks and discussed the recent fighting of the
Indian Corps with him. I considered that a certain amount of blame
attached to the commanders of the units engaged, for embarking in an
attack on trenches so far away from their own line before ensuring
adequate support, especially in view of the muddy condition of the
ground, and knowing, as they did, the exhausted state of the Indian
troops and the effect of cold upon them. At first the General tried to
combat this view; but he soon acknowledged the justice of my
criticism.</p>

<p>I decided, regretfully, to make a change in the command of the Lahore
Division. A commander very often, after having directed operations of
a critical nature, needs rest and change of occupation to restore him
to his full capacity for command.</p>

<p>I met <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> at Chantilly on the morning of the 27th, as arranged.</p>

<p>I explained the mission I had from the British Government, and told
him of their fears of impending severe Russian defeats and of the
possibility, which they thought might be open to the enemy, of
withdrawing large <span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> numbers of troops and massing a force on
the Western front strong enough to break our line and attain, after
all, their original objectives, namely, Paris and the Channel ports. I
told <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> that the English Government were anxious to hear his views
and ideas on the points raised.</p>

<p>The French Commander-in-Chief was much astonished to hear that such a
view of the situation could be really and seriously entertained. But
he added that, of course, the French General Staff had plans ready to
meet any eventuality. He expressed the opinion that the time was not
now opportune for the discussion of such contingent possibilities as
these.</p>

<p>We then talked over the reported Russian deficiencies in munitions of
war, and he entered into some most interesting details as to the state
of the French manufacture of ammunition and guns. He told me that they
were producing almost entirely high-explosive shells and hardly any
shrapnel, and that an enormous improvement was being made in the
pattern of fuze, from which great results were expected. The latest
manufactured ammunition for the "75" gun had shown wonderful results,
particularly in the matter of destroying wire entanglements.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Joffre</span> went on to say that the Russians were in close touch with the
French factories, and were benefiting greatly by the experiments which
had been carried out. Moreover, the French were able to supply the
Russians with a considerable quantity of munitions of war. It took a
long time to transmit; but he entertained great hopes that Roumania
and Bulgaria would soon be in such sympathy with the Allies as to
permit the transport of material to Russia <span class="italic">viâ</span> Salonika. The reports
he had received indicated that the Russians had sufficient ammunition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span> at hand, if they remained on the defensive, for six weeks.</p>

<p>He expressed himself as fairly satisfied with the Russian position and
outlook, and thought the Germans were being so heavily punished that
whole corps would have to be reorganised.</p>

<p>These views were subsequently embodied in a memorandum which I sent to
Lord Kitchener for the information of the War Cabinet.</p>

<p>I then arrived at an understanding with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> as to future plans. I
again urged strongly upon him my conviction that an advance on the
extreme north, in co-operation with our Navy, was the proper <span class="italic">rôle</span>
for British troops to fulfil, and went over all the old arguments. In
effect he rejected my plans again, although holding out hopes that, at
a later stage, the French Army might co-operate in such an advance.</p>

<p>In the absence of support from my own Government, it was hopeless to
say anything more. <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s plan was as follows. He meant to break
through the enemy's line from the south at Rheims and from the west at
<span lang="fr">Arras</span>. He desired to mass as many French Corps as possible behind
these two points; therefore, at all other points of the line the
<span class="italic">rôles</span> must be twofold: (1) to economise troops as much as possible
in the trenches, so as to spare more men for action at decisive
points, and (2) to organise good local reserves to keep the enemy in
the front employed and prevent his sending troops to threatened points
in the line.</p>

<p>As the history of the operations during 1915 will show, this general
strategic idea was the foundation of all our efforts throughout that
year. It brought about for the British Army the Battles of <span lang="fr">Neuve
Chapelle, Ypres</span> (second), <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> <span lang="fr">Festubert</span>, and Loos; and for the
French other important actions, which, although local successes, did
not result in achieving any appreciable advance towards the objectives
which the plans sought to attain.</p>

<p>Those objects were not clearly defined till September, when we began
our last combined attack to attain them and practically failed.</p>

<p>The attitude of our War Office in failing to speed up the manufacture
of munitions of war and the practical collapse of the Russian Armies
were to some extent responsible for the lack of success of our
endeavours. But the detailment of troops and war material to the
Dardanelles was undoubtedly the chief cause.</p>

<p>There was no other course for me to take, under the circumstances,
than to fall in with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>'s view; and in accordance with his plan I
agreed to take over, in conjunction with the Belgians, the whole line
from <span lang="fr">La Bassée</span> to the sea, but only by degrees as troops became
available.</p>

<p>Although <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> at the time agreed in my wish to work the northern
section entirely with the Belgian Army, it would appear that the
French Government still insisted on keeping some hold on that part of
the line with French troops.</p>

<p>On returning to my Headquarters I sent for Bridges, who was now my
representative with His Majesty the King of the Belgians. On the
morning of the 28th, we had a long conference on the subject of
co-operation with the Belgian Army.</p>

<p>I had evolved a scheme in my own mind of amalgamating the Belgian and
British Armies. I wanted to see Belgian brigades of infantry embodied
in our own Army Corps at convenient sections in the line, and to apply
the same process to the cavalry and artillery. This apparent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span>
surrender of independence was no doubt a heavy trial to impose upon
the Belgian General Staff; but I believed it to be the surest and best
method to adopt if we wished to get the highest efforts out of the two
Armies.</p>

<p>When all is said, it must be acknowledged that the standard of
training and war efficiency was higher in our troops than in the
Belgian. This applied particularly to the leaders and the Staff; and,
in spite of the drastic experiences of the Belgian Army during August
and September, our own higher ranks certainly possessed a wider and
more extensive experience in the field.</p>

<p>It can indeed hardly be doubted that a Division composed of two
British infantry brigades and one Belgian would probably have done
more, either in attack or defence, than such a unit composed entirely
of Belgian troops.</p>

<p>Whatever views may be held on this point, it must be allowed that the
scheme I proposed would have ensured a much greater unity of effort.</p>

<p>I talked it all over at great length with Bridges, and on leaving me
he went back to put the proposal before the King of the Belgians. I
entertained little hope of getting a favourable hearing; for, although
I knew the King's lofty spirit and generous impulses would prompt him
to make any personal sacrifice to attain greater power and efficiency
for our united forces, yet I was also well aware of his difficulties
with his own Ministers.</p>

<p>Two days later Bridges brought me His Majesty's answer. He told me it
was possible the King himself might fall in with my suggestion. Ten
thousand rifles would have to be retained for the "inundated" line,
leaving 40,000 rifles available for the proposed amalgamation. This, I
thought, would at once render the united Armies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> strong
enough in the north to justify me in allowing <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> to remove the 9th
and 20th French Corps to the points where he so much needed strength
for his own line.</p>

<p>This amalgamation of the British and Belgian Armies would certainly,
have effected a great economy of force and fighting power, and have
perhaps led to important results; but the scheme never came to
fruition, both because the King of the Belgians was unable to gain the
consent of his Government and because the French would not agree to
the plan. Finally, I could get no support or help from our own people
at home.</p>

<p>On the 27th, the French had some success at <span lang="fr">Carency</span> (north of <span lang="fr">Arras</span>),
capturing several German trenches and advancing the line some 500
yards.</p>

<p class="p2">In spite of the "growls" in which I have so freely indulged, the close
of 1914 yet found me in a hopeful and sanguine frame of mind.</p>

<p>When the state of affairs which might have been came to be compared
with the situation as it was, there was really very little reason for
pessimism. We had scored one great offensive and another great
defensive victory, and we had suffered no severe defeat.</p>

<p>The Germans were bound down behind their entrenchments from the North
Sea to the Swiss frontier, and under the highest trial, the Allies had
proved their ability to hold their actual lines inviolate.</p>

<p>Our Fleet had gained command of the sea, from which they had finally
and completely driven the German flag. The spirit of the Allied
nations was high and confident. On the other hand, had the enemy shown
more of the skill and intrepidity of those great leaders of the
past&mdash;Frederick, Napoleon, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> and von Moltke (whose teachings
German writers of to-day claim that their commanders have so closely
assimilated)&mdash;and the Allies a little less watchfulness and keenness,
we might have seen Paris and the Channel seaboard in the enemy's
hands, the British Army, irretrievably separated from its Allies,
driven to the coast, and the French holding the southern provinces of
the Republic with their capital at Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Finally, Russia, our great hope and mainstay for the future, was
inspiring the utmost hope and encouragement amongst the Allies by the
splendid deeds with which she heralded the close of the year.</p>

<p>The last entry in my diary&mdash;December 31st, 1914&mdash;is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our night conference showed more and increasingly important Russian
successes."</p>

<p>It was good to end the year with courage born of hope and confidence
in the future. Time works wonders in all directions. Just as we could
not foresee the utter collapse and failure of our great Eastern ally,
so we could not discern the hidden forging of that sword of justice
and retribution whose destined wielders were even then stirring from
their fifty years of slumber and dreams of everlasting peace, to rise
like some giant from the shores of the Western Atlantic and, with
overwhelming force, to stride eastward and help lay low the German
dragon once and for all time in the dust.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="18">XVIII</abbr> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span></h3>

<h4>AMMUNITION</h4>

<p>From the beginning of the Battle of the <span lang="fr">Aisne</span> up to the close of the
Battle of Loos, at the end of 1915, the scanty supply of munitions of
war paralysed all our power of initiative and, at critical times,
menaced our defence with irretrievable disaster. Great anxiety on this
subject overshadowed all my direction of military operations, and deep
concern at the failure of the Government to appreciate and remedy our
difficulties from this cause dominated all my work. In this chapter it
is my object to make known some of the efforts I made to awaken both
the Government and the public from that apathy which meant certain
defeat. I exhausted every effort, by urgent official demands to the
War Office, and personal appeals to Lord Kitchener and such Cabinet
Ministers as I came in contact with. When these efforts got no
response, I gave interviews to the press and authorised public men who
visited me to urge this vital necessity in their addresses. Nothing
less than my deliberate conclusion, after all these measures had
failed and nine months of war had elapsed, that the Empire itself was
in jeopardy, forced me to act in May 1915 as I did. I was conscious
before taking this step, which meant the overthrow of the Government,
that it also meant the end of my career in France, with all the hopes
and ambitions that only a soldier can understand. But the
consciousness of the great results achieved in this upheaval has been
my reward, and I trust that a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span> recital of my difficulties
may, if occasion arise in the future, protect the British Army in the
field from the recurrence of any similar situation.</p>

<p>During my term of office as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, from
March 1912 to April 1914, I had urged these vital necessities upon the
Government, but my demands were steadily opposed by the Finance
Department and the Treasury. All our experiences in the South African
War, and the warnings which the Manchurian campaign plainly gave,
passed altogether unheeded in the years preceding the present war. I
was always a strong advocate for the supply of high-explosive shell to
our horse and field artillery, but I got very little support, and even
such as was given to me was lukewarm in the extreme. I believe the
Ordnance Board was not in favour of it.</p>

<p>As early as the middle of September 1914 the British Army in France
was subjected to heavy bombardment from German 8-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> howitzers, to
which they were quite unable to reply. At the same time the daily
expenditure of artillery ammunition became far in excess of the
receipts from home, and we were unable to maintain the stocks on the
lines of communication up to anything like the proper war
establishment. For example, the 18-<abbr title="pounders">pdrs.</abbr> fired an average of 14 rounds
a day, whilst the receipts were barely seven. The 60-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr> guns and the
4.5-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> howitzers fired over 40 rounds a day, against a supply of
eight or nine rounds at most. In private letters and telegrams I had
repeatedly brought this to the notice of the Secretary of State, and a
strong official memorandum on the subject was sent to the War Office
on September 28th. A further communication to the same effect was made
on October 10th; and on the 29th of the same month <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> the War
Office were officially told that the state of the ammunition supply
had necessitated the issue of an order restricting expenditure to 20
rounds per gun daily, and that a further restriction to 10 rounds
would be necessary if the supply did not improve. This was during the
most desperate period of the First Battle of Ypres, when the average
daily expenditure of 18-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr> ammunition had amounted to 81 rounds per
gun.</p>

<p>In some cases the expenditure per gun had reached the enormous total
of 300 rounds daily.</p>

<p>A proportion of at least 25 per cent. of high-explosive shells for 13
and 18 <abbr title="pounders">pdrs.</abbr> was included in the demands to which I have referred
above.</p>

<p>In a communication to the War Office on December 31st, the view was
expressed that considerably more high explosive was necessary, and the
following table was laid down as our minimum requirements to carry on
the war with any prospect of success:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">required output of ammunition.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;
<span class="col70">Rounds per gun a day.</span></li>
<li>13-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr>
<span class="col70">50 (25 <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>18-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr>
<span class="col70">50 (25 <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>4.5-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> howitzer
<span class="col70">40 (35 <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> howitzer
<span class="col70">25 (all <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>60-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr>
<span class="col70">25 (15 <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>4.7-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> gun
<span class="col70">25 (15 <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> gun
<span class="col70">25 (all <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
<li>9.2-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> howitzer
<span class="col70">12 (all <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr>)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>It was explained that this output was necessary for a period of active
operations, and should be continued even during a lull, till a reserve
of three or four times the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> amount laid down in war
establishments had been accumulated. To this request there was no
reply until January 19th. The War Office then declined to work up to
more than 20 rounds a day, and refused a request for 50 per cent, of
high explosives.</p>

<p>This amazing attitude at a most critical time compelled me to consider
means by which the several members of the Government, and the public
also, might be advised of this deplorable apathy which, if long
continued, meant the destruction of our Army.</p>

<p>In this letter from the War Office, of January 19th, which I have
already mentioned, an estimate was attached of the receipts which we
might rely upon up to and including the month of May. This estimate
was far below our requirements, whilst the actual receipts fell far
short of it. The actual supply in May proved to be less than one half
of the War Office estimate, which was the only one ever furnished for
our guidance. Such failure made it quite impossible to make any
reliable forecast of the condition of the ammunition supply at any
particular date. This state of uncertainty rendered the formulation of
plans for co-operating with the French most difficult, if not
impossible.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1914-15 it was hoped to accumulate some small
reserve of ammunition, but, during this period, all our efforts in
this direction were of no avail, because the number of rounds per
18-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr> gun throughout this period fell to less than five!</p>

<p>I had serious misgivings that the <span class="italic">morale</span> of the Army was becoming
affected by this first long and weary winter of inactivity in the
trenches, and to render the defence effective it was necessary to
undertake an offensive operation.</p>

<p>Early <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span> in March a small reserve of ammunition had been
accumulated, and the Battle of <span lang="fr">Neuve Chapelle</span> was fought and won. Had
proper steps been taken to increase the supply when my first strong
appeals were sent in during September 1914, the offensive operation
commenced so successfully at <span lang="fr">Neuve Chapelle</span> might have been much
further developed, and, indeed, possibly have led to great and
important results. But the battle had to be broken off after three
days' fighting because we were brought to a standstill through want of
ammunition.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards I again addressed the strongest representations
I could frame to the War Office. I begged that His Majesty's
Government might be informed that, if their object was to drive the
enemy off French and Belgian territory during 1915, no progress
towards this objective could be obtained unless and until the supply
of artillery ammunition should enable the Army to engage in sustained
operations. The only official reply which I received to this letter
was an injunction to use the utmost economy, but a private letter,
dated March 16th, was addressed by Sir James Wolfe Murray to Sir
William Robertson, who was then my Chief of Staff. This letter was
said to have been dictated by the Secretary of State, and its contents
hinted very strongly that an impression prevailed at the War Office
that we were wasting ammunition.</p>

<p>The operations at <span lang="fr">Neuve Chapelle</span> used up all our available resources,
and it became necessary to restore them by reverting for a time to a
strictly defensive attitude.</p>

<p>It was, moreover, very clear that the Germans had early realised that
the war was to be one calling for colossal supplies of munitions;
supplies, indeed, upon such a stupendous <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> scale as the world
had never before dreamed of, and they also realised the vital
necessity for heavy artillery. They began with an inferior field gun,
and they never stopped to remedy this defect, but directed all their
energies, from the first, to developing their heavy artillery. Whilst
their total proportion of guns to bayonets was fully maintained, the
proportion of field guns to bayonets was reduced, and all heavy guns
enormously increased. Each month the development of heavy artillery
became more accentuated until, towards the late spring of 1915, the
greater number of projectiles fired by the Germans, whenever
operations of any importance were taking place, were of 5.9 and
upwards. This was in defence as well as in attack, and by this means
the enemy endeavoured to shatter the <span class="italic">morale</span> of the attackers, as
well as to inflict very heavy casualties.</p>

<p>The necessity for a great preponderance of heavy artillery was also
recognised by the French long before our War Office could be persuaded
to move in that direction. From early in the war they aimed at
obtaining one heavy gun of 6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> calibre and upwards for every field
gun they held, without reducing the proportion to bayonets of the
latter which obtains in the French Army. To meet these requirements
the French were taking guns from their old warships and coast defence
ships, and straining every nerve to get guns of heavy calibre into the
field.</p>

<p>In May, 1915, the proportion of field to heavy guns above 6-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>
calibre in the French Army was 2.3 to one. At this time the British
Army had but 71 guns altogether above 5-<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> calibre against 1,416
below it, and no adequate steps whatever had yet been taken to bring
the proportion more nearly to the requirements of modern warfare. The
supply <span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> of trench guns and mortars, with their ammunition,
hand-grenades, and other most necessary munitions of war, was almost
negligible, nor was there any active attempt to understand and grapple
vitally with the new problems calling for the application of modern
science to the character of warfare that had developed.</p>

<p>I have referred before to the disinclination of the War Office, prior
to the war, to take up seriously the question of high explosives; the
natural consequence was that the true nature of high-explosive shells,
and the correct particulars which govern their construction, were not
properly understood, as they had too little experience of them.</p>

<p>The deadly nature of modern rifle and machine-gun fire had brought
about trench warfare, which enabled the troops opposite to one another
to approach to ranges which were customary in the days of the
Peninsula and Waterloo. The time-honoured grenades, which were so
marked a feature in those days, were thus resuscitated.</p>

<p>Although the War Office received detailed reports from the Front as to
the employment by the enemy of these new and unfamiliar weapons, no
proper attention was ever paid to these reports. It was their duty to
bring these old-time weapons up to date, and to compete with the new
mechanical inventions constantly being devised by the great
organisation of a thoroughly prepared enemy. But reports from the
Front as to these new and unfamiliar weapons were received with a
carelessness which bordered on incredulity. The critical days in the
early part of November, and during the First Battle of Ypres,
compelled me to devise a plan to meet the exigencies of this grave
emergency. As the fighting settled into trench warfare, the inadequacy
of our weapons to enable us to reply to an enemy thoroughly equipped
with every contrivance for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span> this sort of warfare became
painfully apparent; while even our hand-grenades, by reason of their
faulty construction, frequently did not explode. I was therefore
compelled to conduct experiments in the field, and improvise new
weapons as well as possible. For such work the Army had no
organisation. In this I received invaluable assistance from my friend,
George Moore. Mr. Moore is an American who has had wide experience of
large construction developments in the United States. Although a young
man, he was deeply versed in the method of scientific research as
applied to mechanical invention. Add to this that he was a great
personal friend of my own and passionately interested in the success
of the Allies, and it will be seen how naturally I turned to him for
help and advice in this terrible crisis. Under Mr. Moore's advice and
direction, experiments were carried out with the maximum of speed,
energy and resource, covering the field of the proper construction and
use of high explosives, hand-grenades, trench mortars and bombs; and a
number of factories and small plants were set up for the production,
for use in the field, of properly constructed hand-grenades, bombs and
trench mortars.</p>

<p>As a result of this work in the daily trench struggle that had then
developed, we were rapidly enabled to acquire the accurate knowledge
of the proper use of high explosives, and the appliances necessary to
meet the enemy on his own ground under these novel conditions of
warfare. Mr. Moore from time to time brought men in whom he had trust
and confidence to help in the work. Among them I will only
specifically refer to Colonel Lewis, an American, whose machine gun,
bearing his name, proved of such enormous help in this war, and to
Lieutenant Lawrence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> Breese. This gallant young officer of
the Blues, to which magnificent regiment he belonged, did wonderful
work, and conducted experiments the result of which was of the highest
value; and, after several months of tireless energy, gave his life in
carrying out one of these experiments. This hastily improvised
organisation worked night and day in these trying times, with the
results which enabled us, with success, to meet the enemy in trench
warfare.</p>

<p>During this time I received visits at my Headquarters from prominent
members of both Houses of Parliament, to whom I told, in course of
conversation, the great anxiety I felt on the subject of the shortage
of heavy guns and ammunition.</p>

<p>On March 22nd I gave an interview to the Press, which appeared
generally in the English papers, from which I quote: "It is a rough
war, but the problem it sets is a comparatively simple one&mdash;munitions,
more munitions, always more munitions; this is the essential question,
the governing condition of all progress, of every leap forward." On
March 27th I gave an interview to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in which I said as
follows: "The protraction of the war depends entirely upon the supply
of men and munitions. Should these be unsatisfactory, the war will be
accordingly prolonged. I dwell emphatically on the need for
munitions."</p>

<p>To the public men who visited me, I appealed that they should make
known this grave necessity to the public in their speeches. I quote a
line from a speech of the Earl of Durham, who, at my request, said:
"What we want and must have is more and more munitions."</p>

<p>At a conference at Chantilly with Lord Kitchener, I reminded him of my
constant representations on the subject of munitions, both officially
and privately, and warned <span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span> him that the danger would be fatal
if instant action were not taken to supply our needs.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that all this time, when the British Forces in
France were in absolute jeopardy owing to these deficiencies,
trainloads of all kinds of ammunition were passing along our rear <span class="italic">en
route</span> to Marseilles and the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>This was the situation when on April 22nd the Germans made their first
attack with poisoned gas in the Second Battle of Ypres and, in a
gigantic effort, again attempted to break through; and the defence
called for the most desperate kind of fighting, only surpassed in
intensity by the struggle in the First Battle of Ypres. Just about
this time, the then Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, made his famous
Newcastle speech, in which he stated that the Army had all the
ammunition it required. When I read this speech, after all my public
and private appeals, I lost any hope that I had entertained of
receiving help from the Government as then constituted. So that, on
May 9th, 1915, when we commenced the Battle of <span lang="fr">Festubert</span>, an operation
undertaken to relieve the intense pressure on the troops at <span lang="fr">Ypres</span>, my
mind was filled with keen anxiety. After all our demands, less than 8
per cent. of our shells were high explosive, and we had only
sufficient supply for about 40 minutes of artillery preparation for
this attack. On the tower of a ruined church I spent several hours in
close observation of the operations. Nothing since the Battle of the
<span lang="fr">Aisne</span> had ever impressed me so deeply with the terrible shortage of
artillery and ammunition as did the events of that day. As I watched
the <span lang="fr">Aubers</span> ridge, I clearly saw the great inequality of the artillery
duels, and, as attack after attack failed, I could see that the
absence of sufficient artillery support was doubling <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span> and
trebling our losses in men. I therefore determined on taking the most
drastic measures to destroy the apathy of a Government which had
brought the Empire to the brink of disaster. A friend was standing by
my side on the tower, and to him I poured out my doubts and fears and
announced my determination. He warned me that the politicians would
never forgive the action I proposed, and that it meant my certain
recall from the command in France. But my decision was made, and I
immediately started for my Headquarters, fully determined on my future
course of action.</p>

<p>If any additional proof were required of the hopelessness of any
relief coming from the War Office, I found it waiting for me when I
reached Headquarters that afternoon, in the shape of a telegram from
the Secretary of State for War, directing that 20 per cent. of our
scanty reserve supply of ammunition was to be shipped to the
Dardanelles. I immediately gave instructions that evidence should be
furnished to Colonel Repington, military correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>,
who happened to be then at Headquarters, that the vital need of
high-explosive shells had been a fatal bar to our Army success on that
day. I directed that copies of all the correspondence which had taken
place between myself and the Government on the question of the supply
of ammunition be made at once, and I sent my Secretary, Brinsley
FitzGerald, with Captain Frederick Guest, one of my <abbr title="aide de camp">A.D.C.s</abbr>, to
England with instructions that these proofs should be laid before Mr.
Lloyd George, who had already shown me, by his special interest in
this subject, that he grasped the deadly nature of our necessities. I
instructed also that they should be laid before Mr. Arthur J. Balfour
and Mr. Bonar Law, whose sympathetic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> understanding of my
difficulties, when they visited me in France, had led me to expect
that they would take the action that this grave exigency demanded.
Together with the correspondence, I sent the following memorandum:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="italic">Secret.</span>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">information regarding ammunition</span>.</p>

<p>1. Large quantities of high-explosive shells for field guns have
become essential owing to the form of warfare in which the Army is
engaged. The enemy is entrenched from the sea to the Swiss frontier.
There is no flank in his position that can be turned. It is necessary,
therefore, for all offensive operations to start by breaking the
enemy's line, which presupposes the attack of formidable field
entrenchments. Shrapnel, being the man-killing projectile which is
used against troops in the open, is primarily used in defence. In
offensive operations it is used for searching communication trenches,
preventing the enemy's reinforcements intervening in the fight,
repelling counter-attacks, and, as an alternative for high-explosive
shell, for cutting wire entanglements. It is, however, ineffective
against the occupants of the trenches, breastworks, or buildings. It
is, therefore, necessary to have high-explosive shell to destroy
parapets, obstacles, buildings, and many forms of fortified localities
that the enemy constructs, more particularly his machine-gun
emplacements. Without an adequate supply the attack is impotent
against the defenders of field fortifications, as the first step
cannot be taken. Guns require 50 per cent. of high-explosive shell.
Howitzers use high-explosive shell almost exclusively.</p>

<p>2. We have found by experience that the field guns actually engaged in
offensive operations, such as <span lang="fr">Neuve Chapelle</span>, fire about 120 rounds
per gun per day.</p>

<p>Heavy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span> guns and howitzers, according to their calibre, fire
less in proportion. The guns of the whole Army are of course never
equally heavily engaged at the same time, but the number of guns
available and the amount of ammunition are the limiting factors when a
plan of attack is being considered. There is, therefore, scarcely any
limit to the supply of ammunition that could be usefully employed. The
more ammunition, the bigger the scale on which the attack can be
delivered, and the more persistently it can be pressed.</p>

<p>Demands must, however, be reasonable, and our position would be very
greatly improved if our supply reached the figures in the attached
Table "A" within three months. Up to the present it has been below
these figures.</p>

<p>Colonel FitzGerald and Captain Guest reported that on May 12th and
14th they had carried out my instructions and laid the facts before
Mr. Lloyd George, Mr. Balfour and Mr. Bonar Law. On May 15th, Colonel
Repington's article appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. The world knows what then
happened. The Coalition Government was formed, with Mr. Lloyd George
as Minister of Munitions; and, though delays afterwards occurred, the
problem was at last faced with the intelligence and energy that its
gravity demanded, and I feel that for his work on munitions we owe
unmeasured gratitude to Mr. Lloyd George. The successful solution of
the problem came when he applied to it that matchless energy which has
enabled him to come <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span> through the great ordeal as England's
most valued leader in her direst hour.</p>

<p>For my unprecedented action I claim that no other course lay open to
me. To organise the nation's industrial resources upon a stupendous
scale was the only way if we were to continue with success the great
struggle which lay before us, and I feel that the result achieved
fully warranted the steps I took.<a href="#toc"><span class="smaller">(Back to Content)</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 7:</strong> A short speech which I made on this occasion in the House
of Lords expressed my great appreciation of Lord Kitchener's capacity
as a leader in the field.</p>

<p>I told the House that, after I received intimation of my appointment
to command in France, my first act was to seek out my old South
African Chief and suggest to him that we should repair together to the
Prime Minister and ask that he might be appointed to command, with me
as his Chief of Staff. He could not be persuaded to do this.</p>

<p>He was then on the point of leaving to return to Egypt, and had no
idea that he was to be Secretary of State for War.</p>

<p>I do not think Lord Kitchener was always credited by the country with
the talent for command in the field which I know he really possessed,
whilst, on the other hand, a <span class="italic">rôle</span> for which he was not well fitted
was thrust upon him. As Commander-in-chief in France it would have
helped him very much to have had a Secretary of State <span class="italic">other than
himself</span> to deal with.<a href="#footnotetag7"><span class="smaller">(Back to Main Text)</span></a></p>
